<p>I work at Gizra, so it was only a matter of time before Elm infected me as well, and I think it&rsquo;s growing on me.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something a little different, not just the plain old TodoMVC. So, I harnessed every bit of creativity I had and came up with the most radical idea ever - I took the TodoMVC in Elm and got it to work in Electron, and called it <code>Elmctron</code> (I know, so creative of me).</p>

<p><a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> enables you to build cross platform desktop apps with web technologies. So we can take all the goodies we get with Elm and use them in our desktop application. It&rsquo;s a brand new world!</p>

<p>It was my thought that we should build a couple of gulp tasks to make our life easier - to do the bare minimum because after all, who wants to do more than we he have to? (let&rsquo;s hope my boss will not read this part)</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, the only commands I want to run are <code>git clone ..</code>, <code>npm install</code>, and <code>gulp</code>. The gulp tasks should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile SASS to css.</li>
<li>Compile Elm to JS.</li>
<li>Watch and auto-reload.</li>
<li>Automagically download and install elm packages.</li>
<li>Start the electron app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try it for yourself by forking the <a href="https://github.com/nirgn975/Elmctron">GitHub repo</a>. After <code>npm install</code>, just run <code>gulp</code> and see your Elmctron app:</p>

<p>After gulp does its thing, your desktop app will open:</p>

<p>Tada! Your Elm app runs inside Electron. And as I promised, all of the above just happens for you.</p>

<p>Also, to help devs start, I&rsquo;ve set it up so <a href="https://github.com/nirgn975/Elmctron/blob/master/main-electron.js#L31-L32">the devtools will open</a> when the app fires up.</p>
