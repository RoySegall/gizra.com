<p>It&rsquo;s powered by <a href="http://shoov.io">Shoov</a>. Did we mention Shoov before? I <a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/shoov-ci-tests-live-site">think</a> <a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/cross-browser-visual-regression-with-shoov">we</a> <a href="http://www.gizra.com/content/visual-regression-travis-shoov-ngrok">did</a>. Basically every project we work on has full test coverage - like everyone&rsquo;s, I know - but Shoov also provides us with a visual regression testing harness.</p>

<p>Shoov constantly runs its tests in the background, 24x7. When everything passes the project icon is green. When a test fails, it&rsquo;s red. The monitor sits in the main room, so everyone can see when there&rsquo;s an issue and feel deeply ashamed of their fragile, error-prone, carbon based brains.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m kidding of course. We all make mistakes - we&rsquo;re only human. But Shoov isn&rsquo;t.</p>
