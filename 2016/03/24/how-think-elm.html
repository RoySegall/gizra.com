<p>The 2nd Elm - TLV meetup was lots of fun. But it was in Hebrew, and the intersection
between Hebrew speakers and Elm devs is still very limited.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve re-recorded my presentation in English. If you haven&rsquo;t ever seen Elm, or
already develop in Elm and want to better understand &ldquo;how to think Elm&rdquo; this presentation
might give you a nudge in the right direction.</p>
