        <h2>Baseball, Apple Pie, and Web Frameworks</h2>

<p>I like baseball better than football (the American version). Football is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c">game of inches</a> &ndash; but it&rsquo;s measured in yards. Imprecise scope is built into the system. Baseball, on the other hand, is a game of wildly random occurrences that are often measured to the third decimal place. An <a href="http://sabr.org/sabermetrics">entire framework exists</a> to understand the smallest, yet important, details of the game.</p>

<p>What I like about baseball is what I like about the current state of web applications. There is a growing set of frameworks that allow you to &ldquo;scratch your own itch&rdquo; and be precise about your scope in ways that you never could before. I really like going to web conferences, and seeing things like Drupal being used as a backend to serve content to some other front-end framework (enter your favorite: Angular, React, Ember) that can bend, shape, and re-present that content in ways that Drupal never imagined.</p>

<p>And as a web development agency that focuses on complex content management, that has huge &ndash; and really exciting &ndash; implications for how we do business.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s a Major Corporation To Do?</h2>

<p>Take for example a conversation that started with someone that does training and assessment at a Fortune 50 corporation &ndash; one that trains a lot of employees. At some point she asked me &ldquo;Do you guys do inbox simulations?&rdquo; I had to think for a second if I even knew what inbox simulation was - and it turns out, it&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like: a simulated email inbox to test and assess an employee&rsquo;s response and prioritization skills. </p>

<p>My first response was &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and my second &ndash; almost immediate &ndash; followup was, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see why we couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The problem they had was that none of the software they had tried was giving them precisely what they needed. And that&rsquo;s not surprising. There are more than 500 Learning Management Systems on the market, each with it&rsquo;s own bloated feature set trying to solve specific use cases with general tools. It&rsquo;s also not surprising that <a href="http://www.capterra.com/learning-management-system-software/user-research">fewer than 25%</a> of corporate LMS users are &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with their system. Given the large features sets and the likely time it took to get them to market, most of them are probably built on technology that&rsquo;s already five years old.</p>

<h2>Enter Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>That conversation led to a &ldquo;show us what you can do&rdquo; meeting. This was a problem because, well, we had never done it before. My five-or-six-years-ago brain said to myself, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t possibly create a demo of an inbox simulation &ndash; I&rsquo;ll just put together a slide deck that explains what I&rsquo;m talking about here with web frameworks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when <a href="http://www.gizra.com/team/#amitaibu">Amitai</a> said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s create an inbox simulation for your meeting &ndash; we can do it in <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. Open a repo and I&rsquo;ll show you how. What should it have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered (dubiously), &ldquo;Well, it should look and feel like an Outlook inbox, and we should be able to demonstrate that their training logic can be applied to simple email tasks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean like if you respond one way, you get a certain response back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, something like that.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Scaffolding of an Inbox</h2>

<p>So I opened a <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation">repository</a> for the project, which at Gizra starts with a stack that includes a location to create static prototype pages served by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is automatically updated and published by <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. The <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> CSS framework is included so that we get all the goodies that come with it and don&rsquo;t need to recreate the wheel on design elements (we recently switched from Bootstrap, and I already like it a lot better, if not just because our prototypes don&rsquo;t look like <a href="http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/">every Bootstrap website ever</a>).</p>

<p>In a perfect world, I wanted three things: </p>

<ol>
<li>An <strong>inbox</strong> that looked realistic.</li>
<li>A <strong>dashboard</strong> that reflected activity in the inbox. </li>
<li>An <strong>admin screen</strong> that allowed manipulation of the inbox content.</li>
</ol>

<p>I started with the admin screen, because that seemed the least daunting.</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <div class="img-wrapper">

    

    
      <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/admin-sketch.jpg">
    

  </div>
  
    <div class="caption">I am a terrible sketch artist, and I often don&rsquo;t carry paper. This was sketched on a napkin from a coffee shop.</div>
  
</div>

<p>Once I had the idea, I moved quickly into the static prototype, because my CSS skills dramatically outweigh my drawing skills.</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <div class="img-wrapper">

    

    
      <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/admin-prototype.jpg">
    

  </div>
  
    <div class="caption">That&rsquo;s a little better.</div>
  
</div>

<p>The next step was the inbox itself, and because I wanted it to look like Outlook, we figured we could try to grab the HTML, CSS and JS from an Outlook Online account that I had created for this purpose. </p>

<p>What a ridiculous mess that was. </p>

<p>Thirty minutes into that task, I realized it would be easier to recreate the inbox from scratch. Semantic UI made it pretty easy.The Font Awesome icons already there, and the fact that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/">flexbox</a> friendly, meant that I had a pretty good static version up in about 4 hours (it could have been faster, but it was my first time really using Semantic UI, and I was trying to follow strict <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> principles, which we also recently started at Gizra).</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <div class="img-wrapper">

    

    
      <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/inbox-prototype.jpg">
    

  </div>
  
    <div class="caption">Starting to look like the real thing.</div>
  
</div>

<p>And with that, I made a pull request, and went to bed.</p>

<h2>Making it dynamic with Elm</h2>

<p>The next day, some strange miracle had occurred.</p>

<p>Amitai had <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/6">created a basic Elm app</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/8">converted my HTML markup to Elm</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/12">created a basic model for a functioning app</a>. I had heard Amitai speak and have read about how Elm&rsquo;s compiler, which catches runtime errors, makes development so much faster, but seeing it in action was pretty amazing. Our conversation on Github:</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <div class="img-wrapper">

    

    
      <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/github-conversation.jpg">
    

  </div>
  
    <div class="caption">The Elm is strong with this one.</div>
  
</div>

<p>Creating that dashboard referenced in the conversation was faitly easy too. Semantic UI has a lot of <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html">nice looking tables</a> and classes to vary the look enough to get a lot of different options. I found one I liked, filled it with enough dummy data to give it the feel of a real dashboard, and we were all set.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Amitai created a nifty little delayed response function. If you choose a particular response (in this case, some version of &ldquo;ignore&rdquo;), you get a followup email demanding your attention.</p>

<div class="thumbnail">
  <div class="img-wrapper">

    

    
      <img src="http://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/delayed-response.gif">
    

  </div>
  
    <div class="caption">Don&rsquo;t ignore my emails!.</div>
  
</div>

<p>We spent the next day or two refining features, polishing the layout, and replacing the dummy text.</p>

<p>Of course, I needed to add a few tweaks to the layout, and add sample emails that were more realistic, and some logic that made sense. To do that I had to get into Elm and figure out how it works - in particular how to make it present the HTML syntax I needed. It turns out that was pretty logical and straightforward. I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface, but I&rsquo;m pretty pleased to have my first few commits on an Elm project.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation">Github repository</a> and try out the <a href="http://inbox-simulation.gizra.com/">sample application</a>, but the final product is a simple response to a complex need. We got there in several days by breaking down a complex problem into small surmountable tasks - a method we call <a href="http://www.gizra.com/#gizra-way">The Gizra Way</a>. In this case, we ignored all other features, even how to permanently store the data &ndash; just a simple single page application that shows a realistic inbox with a few features. I never got my admin screen - there wasn&rsquo;t enough time, and there&rsquo;s other stuff to do.</p>

<p>We are, of course, helped enormously by a robust set of web frameworks that are helping us do web tasks, faster, with greater flexibility, and with a preciseness like never before.</p>
