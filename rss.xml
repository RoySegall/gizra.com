        <title>My New Insecurity: Working Without Automatic Tests</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-at-gizra&quot;&gt;Testing at Gizra&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have covered the subject of automatic tests quite a lot here at Gizra and I’m sure that there are a lot of posts and articles covering the subject. However, I’m having a bizarre experience lately while writing new features that I had to share it with you folks. Keep in mind that I don’t write a lot of blog posts and I always feared following up on my previous smashing hit &lt;a href=&quot;/content/custom-breakpoint-bootstrap-sass/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap custom breakpoint&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the experience I want to talk about was that of insecurity, which was quite odd for me considering I’m always proud of my code until &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amitaibu&quot;&gt;@amitaibu&lt;/a&gt; reviews it and smashes my ego to pieces (which I learned to love).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s So Special About the Gizra Way</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Efrat, Rachel, and Adam discuss what it’s like to work at a company that does things differently - finding the right balance between challenging the status quo and
learning from it. In response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/e0ipso/status/953727237848748039&quot;&gt;some Twitter questions&lt;/a&gt;, we talked a bit about a newly-distributed and international workforce and some of our learnings. We also chatted
about the long-term results of &lt;a href=&quot;/content/job-post-goes-viral/&quot;&gt;A Job Post Goes Viral&lt;/a&gt; and welcoming
diversity at a company.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Travis - The Need for Speed</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Chances are that you already use Travis or another cool CI to execute your tests, and everyone politely waits for the CI checks before even thinking about merging, right? More likely, waiting your turn becomes a pain and you click on the merge: it’s a trivial change and you need it now. If this happens often, then it’s the responsibility of those who worked on those scripts that Travis crunches to make some changes. There are some trivial and not so trivial options to make the team always be willing to wait for the completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is for you if you have a project with Travis integration, and you’d like to maintain and optimize it, or just curious what’s possible. Users of other CI tools, keep reading, many areas may apply in your case too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other performance optimization areas, doing before-after benchmarks is not so crucial, as Travis mostly collects the data, you just have to make sure to do the math and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/pull/171#issuecomment-334493419&quot;&gt;present the numbers proudly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caching&quot;&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, if your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; lacks the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cache:&lt;/code&gt; directive, then you might start in the easiest place: caching dependencies. For a Drupal-based project, it’s a good idea to think about caching all the modules and libraries that must be downloaded to build the project (it uses a buildsystem, doesn’t it?). So even a variant of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;directories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$HOME/.composer/cache/files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or for Drush&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;directories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$HOME/.drush/cache&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s explained well in the verbose &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; at Travis-ci.com. Before your script is executed, Travis populates the cache directories automatically from a successful previous build. If your project has only a few packages, it won’t help much, and actually it can make things even slower. What’s critical is that we need to cache slow-to-generate, easy-to-download materials. Caching a large ZIP file would not make sense for example, caching many small ones from multiple origin servers would be more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point, you could just read the standard documentation instead of this blog post, but we also have icing on the cake for you. A Drupal installation can take several minutes, initializing all the modules, executing the logic of the install profile and so on. Travis is kind enough to provide a bird’s-eye view on what eats up build time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/travis-speed/travis-benchmark.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Execution speed measurements built in the log
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind the bottleneck when making a decision on what to cache and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, it means cache of the installed, initialized Drupal database and the full document root. Cache invalidation is hard, we can’t change that, but it turned out to be a good compromise between complexity and execution speed gain, check our examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/pre_cache.sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pre_cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/post_cache.sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post_cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your homework and cache what’s the most resource-consuming to generate, SQL database, built source code or compiled binary, Travis is here to assist with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-versions&quot;&gt;Software Versions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons to pay attention to software versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-pre-installed-versions&quot;&gt;Use Pre-installed Versions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis uses containers of different distributions, let’s say you use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trusty&lt;/code&gt;, the default one these days, then if you choose   PHP 7.0.7, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/trusty/#PHP-images&quot;&gt;pre-installled&lt;/a&gt;, in case of 7.1, it’s needed to fetch separately and that takes time for every single build. When you have production constraints, that’s almost certainly more important to match, but in some cases, using the pre-installed version can speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And moreover, let’s say you prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#MariaDB&quot;&gt;MariaDB&lt;/a&gt; over MySQL, then do not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; and start to install it with the package manager, as there is the add-on system to make it available. The same goes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.
Stick to what’s inside the image already if you can.  Exploit that possibility of what Travis can fetch via the YML definition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-latest-and-or-greatest&quot;&gt;Use the Latest and (or) Greatest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever read an article about the performance gain from migrating to PHP 7, you sense the importance of selecting the versions carefully. If your build is PHP-execution heavy, fetching PHP 7.2 (it’s another leap, but mind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/manual/en/migration72.incompatible.php&quot;&gt;backward incompatibilities&lt;/a&gt;) could totally make sense and it’s as easy as can be after making your code compatible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;7.2'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly, a similar thing could be written about Node.js, or relational databases, etc. If you know what’s the bottleneck in your build and find the best performing versions – newer or older – it will improve your speed. Does that conflict with the previous point about pre-installed versions? Not really, just measure which one helps your build the most!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-parallel&quot;&gt;Make it Parallel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Travis job is running, 2 cores and 4 GBytes of RAM is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#Virtualization-environments&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; – that’s something to rely on! Downloading packages should happen in parallel. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drush make&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/code&gt; and other tools like that might use it out of the box: check your parameters and configfiles. However, on the higher level, let’s say you’d like to execute a unit test and a browser-based test, as well. You can ask Travis to spin up two (or more) containers concurrently. In the first, you can install the unit testing dependencies and execute it; then the second one can take care of only the functional test. We have a fine-grained example of this approach in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/.travis.yml#L10&quot;&gt;Drupal-Elm Starter&lt;/a&gt;, where 7 containers are used for various testing and linting. In addition to the great execution speed reduction, the benefit is that the result is also more fine-grained, instead of having a single boolean value, just by checking the build, you have an overview what can be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it’s a warm fuzzy feeling that Travis is happy to create so many containers for your humble project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/travis-speed/parallel.gif&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      If it's independent, no need to serialize the execution
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utilize-ram&quot;&gt;Utilize RAM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available memory is currently between 4 and 7.5 GBytes , depending on the configuration, and it should be used as much as possible. One example could be to move the database main working directory to a memory-based filesystem. For many simpler projects, that’s absolutely doable and at least for Drupal, a solid speedup. Needless to say, we have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/install_server.sh#L13&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; and on client projects, we saw 15-30% improvement at SimpleTest execution. For traditional RMDBS, you can give it a try. If your DB cannot fit in memory, you can still ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/09/20/innodb-performance-optimization-basics-updated/&quot;&gt;InnoDB to fill memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your use case – even moving the whole document root there could be legitimate. Also if you need to compile a source code, doing it there makes sense as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-your-own-docker-image&quot;&gt;Build Your Own Docker Image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your project is really exotic or a legacy one, it potentially makes sense to maintain your own Docker image and then download and execute it in Travis. We did it in the past and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/pull/165/files&quot;&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt;. Maintaining your image means recurring effort, fighting with outdated versions, unavailable dependencies, that’s what to expect. Still, even it could be a type of performance optimization if you have lots of software dependencies that are hard to install on the current Travis container images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---debug-with-ease&quot;&gt;+1 - Debug with Ease&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work on various improvements in the Travis integration for your projects, it’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; to spot issues quickly. What worked on localhost, might or might not work on Travis – and you should know the root cause quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, we propagated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/pull/165/files&quot;&gt;video recording&lt;/a&gt;, now I’d recommend something else. You have a web application, for all the backend errors, there’s a tool to access the logs, at Drupal, you can use Drush. But what about the frontend? Headless Chrome is neat, it has built-in debugging capability, the best of which is that you can break out of the box using Ngrok. Without any X11 forwarding (which is not available) or a local hack to try to mimic Travis, you can play with your app running in the Travis environment. All you need to do is to execute a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/pull/165/files&quot;&gt;Debug build&lt;/a&gt;, execute the installation part (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;travis_run_before_install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;travis_run_install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;travis_run_before_script&lt;/code&gt;), start Headless Chrome (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google-chrome --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222&lt;/code&gt;), download &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/download&quot;&gt;Ngrok&lt;/a&gt;, start a tunnel (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok http 9222&lt;/code&gt;), visit the exposed URL from your local Chrome and have fun with inspection, debugger console, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway&quot;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on such improvements has benefits of many kinds. The entire development team can enjoy the shorter queues and faster merges, and you can go ahead and apply part of the enhancements to your local environment, especially if you dig deep into database performance optimization and make the things parallel. And even more, clients love to hear that you are going to speed up their sites, as this mindset should be also used at production.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expressing a Relationship between Multiple Types in Elm</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Elm’s type system is sufficiently sophisticated that you’ll often want to make
fine-grained distinctions between roughly similar types.  In a
&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/#e-heza-emr-application&quot;&gt;recent project&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, we ended up
with a separate type for a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:nofathers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:nofathers&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/code&gt;
is a little different than a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt;. Most obviously, mothers have children,
whereas (at least, in our data model) children do not. So, it was nice for them
to be separate types. In fact, there were certain operations which could be done
on a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/code&gt; but not a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt; (and vice versa). So it was nice to be able to
enforce that at the type level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mother&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Child&lt;/code&gt; clearly have a lot in common as well. For this
reason, it sometimes felt natural to write functions that could accept either.  So, in
those cases, it was a little awkward for them to be separate types.  Something
was needed to express a relationship between the two types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What alternatives are available to do this sort of thing in Elm? Which did we
end up choosing? For answers to these questions, and more, read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:nofathers&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;There were no fathers in our app’s data model. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:nofathers&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Walking the Tightrope without a Net: Prototyping in Browser with CSS Grid</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I was reviewing some ideas with a client about his homepage. It was a pretty typical issue – some dynamic content (in this case, educational resources) that needed to be arranged and highlighted in different ways in order to draw in users. There are a lot of known patterns to use here some of which would work well. I had a few ideas – none of them particularly earth-shattering – that might solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the next step?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have gone to a designer, translated the idea, waited for PSDs to come back, shared with the client, and rinsed and repeated. A totally valid and worthwhile process in cases where a designer’s creative treatment is needed. But in this simple (and low-budget) scenario, there were some clear tropes that could be used. Of course, there are prototype apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axure.com/&quot;&gt;Axure&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven’t really found the case where fumbling through these tools myself was worth the learning curve. Here’s where CSS-Grid settled into the process really nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I had been following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/&quot;&gt;CSS-Grid Specification&lt;/a&gt; quite closely – mainly through the Twitter feeds of leading advocates and members of the CSS Working Group like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jensimmons&quot;&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/a&gt; (more on the importance of that below) – I was eager to try it out in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided more than a year ago to leave my comfortable job to join Gizra, I knew it would be challenging, but I did not imagine it would bring me face to face with my greatest fear - speaking English. Gizra has a lot of overseas clients, and over the past year, as we become more distributed, most of our new hires have joined from abroad. Obviously, this requires communicating in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My romance with English went wrong somewhere in high school. There was this boy, who sat behind me in English class that liked to tease me. Everytime I opened my mouth to speak, I could feel his eyes at my back. By chance, I also had a crush on him, which made the whole experience even worse. Twenty years have passed and I still feel his eyes boring into my back whenever I speak English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came for a job interview in Gizra, no one asked me about my English proficiency. It is reasonable to assume that if they had asked, I would have given up the job opportunity and stayed where I was. But for some unusual reason they didn’t ask, and when I realized what was required of me, it was too late. I was deep in the water and had no choice but to start swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I found myself having to do my job, that I do well, in a different language. It’s like asking you to eat soup with chopsticks. You are hungry, you want to eat the soup, but you can’t scoop it up. It is a frustrating experience. Most of the time I felt stupid, not finding the words for what I wanted to say, not succeeding in expressing my ideas. I managed to repress this difficulty and not really deal with it. But then came the annual talk with the bosses, my Job title changed and became one that required more interaction with clients, and Amitai said - “You need to improve your English”. I felt my stomach cramp and from that moment on, I knew, I needed to be all in or completely out. I decided to go for it, because when you leave your comfort zone, the magic begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;courage-is-resistance-to-fear-mastery-of-fear-not-absence-of-fear---mark-twain&quot;&gt;“Courage is Resistance to Fear, Mastery of Fear, Not Absence of Fear” - Mark Twain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I begin mastering my fear? Instead of continuing to bypass it, I made it a task. ‘Doing’ does not leave room for anything else. My first task was to find an English tutor. It did not seem right and in the end a search ‘fear of English’ brought me to an English Anxiety Therapist - yes, that is a thing. I just needed four sessions to continue on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;english-is-a-journey-not-a-destination&quot;&gt;English is a Journey, not a Destination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer we were on a family trip to the United States. This, of course, was a great opportunity to improve my English, but it was not the most significant thing I learned on this trip. I discovered that my son speaks excellent English, which was inversely proportional to his grades in school. “How do you know English so well?” I asked him. “Well mom”, he gave me his winning look, “remember this question the next time you complain that I spend too much time on YouTube”. Then I realized - to improve my English, I have to make it part of my daily life. And to make it part of my daily life, I have to enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children learn to speak by hearing the language and then, one day, they just open their mouth and start talking, imitating what they heard. So I also started to listen to the language - I downloaded the TED application, found lectures that interested me, and turned on the English subtitles to help with unclear pronunciations. Learning English stopped being a goal that needed to be achieved, but a pleasant way to walk - it made learning a whole lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidence-comes-from-not-always-being-right-but-from-not-fearing-to-be-wrong---peter-t-mcintyre&quot;&gt;“Confidence Comes from Not Always Being Right, but from Not Fearing To Be Wrong.” - Peter T. Mcintyre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commonplace way to teach English in our schools assumes that the ability to speak fluent English will come from understanding the technical aspects of the language. Well, that’s not true. Remember that boy from the beginning of my story? I remember him very well and I know that the ability to speak fluent English will not come from knowing all the grammar rules but rather come from finding the courage to open my mouth and make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I asked myself quite a bit is, how did my bosses allow me to train and meet with customers with my English level? After all, with clients we have to be presentable. But that’s what I appreciate so much about Gizra, they trust you and count on you to get better. All you have to do is the best you can - including making mistakes, so you can learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first training session in English with clients was very stressful. I prepared by writing a script and began memorizing it, but at some point I understood that reading from the page would hinder communication.  I reminded myself that not having the exact words does not mean I can’t communicate. I have other tools like alternative words, facial expressions, tone of voice, and a smile, that will allow me to get my point across.  If I am confident in what have to offer, everything else will fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-guided-imagery&quot;&gt;Use Guided Imagery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Pilates teacher keeps reminding me that it is not about what we can do with our body, but rather what we can imagine we can do with it. Before a training session or meeting with a client that is conducted in English, I imagine a successful meeting. This way I teach my mind that it’s possible. It helps reduce stress, to relax, and concentrate on what really matters  - the content of the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;last-but-not-least&quot;&gt;Last but Not Least&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a long way to achieving the level of English I would like. Writing this post is part of the process, in both working on my confidence and actually practicing my English. To admit to my co-workers, and then in front of the readers of this blog, that there’s something I am really struggling with, is not an easy thing to do, but I’m glad I work in a place where this is possible.  At this point what is most important for me is that I finally set out on this path. From here I just need to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you wonder how the Chinese eat soup only with chopsticks… well, they don’t. They also use a spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Integrating Javascript into Elm: Alternatives to Ports</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Once you start writing apps (and packages) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;, it’s
tempting to avoid the rough-and-tumble world of Javascript as much as possible.
Yet when implementing features for paying clients, it doesn’t always make sense
to take things that already have a Javascript implementation and re-implement
them in pure Elm. In fact, sometimes it isn’t even possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Elm has a very fine mechanism for integrating bits of Javascript when
necessary – &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/a&gt;!
Yet ports aren’t always the right answer, and there are several alternatives
which can be useful in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post, I’m going to assume that you’re familiar with
the many cases in which ports work well, and focus instead on a few cases where
you might want to try something else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you want synchronous answers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you need some context when you get the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you want to manage parts of the DOM using Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Have Your Cake and Eat it Too: Elm Apps in Drupal Panels</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I tell my kids all the time that they can’t have both - whether it’s ice cream and cake or pizza and donuts - and they don’t like it. It’s because kids are uncorrupted, and their view of the world is pretty straightforward - usually characterized by a simple question: why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it goes with web projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder:&lt;/strong&gt; I want it to be like [&lt;em&gt;insert billion dollar company&lt;/em&gt;]’s site where the options refresh as the user makes choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Thinks to self, “Do you know how many millions of dollars went into that?”&lt;/em&gt;] Hmm, well, it’s complicated…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you mean? I’ve seen it in a few places [&lt;em&gt;names other billion dollar companies&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Gosh, you know, you’re right&lt;/em&gt;] Well, I mean, that’s a pretty sophisticated application, and well, your current site is Drupal, and well, Drupal is in fact really great for decoupled solutions, but generally we’d want to redo the whole architecture… and that’s kind of a total rebuild…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder:&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;eyes glazed over&lt;/em&gt;] Yeah, we don’t want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s is a way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Selling an Item for $1.6M with Elm and Headless Drupal</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;If you happen to know Brice - my colleague and Gizra’s CEO - you probably have picked up that he doesn’t get rattled too easily. While I find myself developing extremely annoying ticks during stressful situations, Brice is a role model for stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine that with the fact that he knows I dislike speaking on the phone, let alone at 6:53pm, almost two hours after my work day is over, you’d probably understand why I was surprised to get a call from him. “Surprised” as in, immediately getting a stomach ache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I got that call from him was a Sale day. You see, we have this product we’ve developed called ״Circuit Auction״, which allows auction houses to manage their catalog and run live, real-time, auction sales - the “Going once, Going twice” type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; “Listen Bruce,” (that’s how I call him) “I’m on my way to working out. Did something crash?”
I don’t always think that the worst has happened, but you did just read the background.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting a long pause. In a way, I think he kind of enjoys those moments, where he knows I don’t know if it’s good or bad news. In a way, I think I actually do somehow enjoy them myself. But instead he said, “Are you next to a computer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; “No. I’m in the car. Should I turn back? What happened?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hate to do this, but in order for his next sentence to make sense I have to go back exactly 95 years, to 1922 Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Write Your First Bot Using Nuntius</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t noticed, we are on the verge of a new era - the bot era!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Dramatic music in the background&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort of… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4na-wZte6Co&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; showed
us what it could really be. Though, we need to understand that for now, bots
are more like what Dries showed us in his
keynote at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/q25eaJHpXFo?t=1h7m30s&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ro-bot-101&quot;&gt;Ro-bot 101&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a bot? If you’ve ever said &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hey Siri&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OK Google&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hey Cortona&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/code&gt;,
then you have interacted with a bot. That bot received an input, returned an output -
it woke you up, reminded you of something, sent an email, or ordered
a new book from Amazon - and you if you’re lucky, a drone delivered it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;platforms-and-technologies&quot;&gt;Platforms and technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand what a bot is, let’s start to see how we can write one.
Any chat platform provide bots, and there are two
ways for them to communicate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web sockets&lt;/strong&gt; - Though we use this technology for push events to the user’s
browser, platforms provide a web socket channel and push events when something
happens in a channel in which your bot is listening.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web hooks&lt;/strong&gt; - In this case you get http requests with the information on
events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Telegram all provide integrations with bots in
one way or another, but in this post we will focus on Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-your-first-bot-is-easier-than-you-think&quot;&gt;Writing Your First Bot is Easier than You Think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, create a bot in your team. You can do it under
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://yourteam.slack.com/apps&lt;/code&gt; and create a custom bot integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you’ll need to start with a library. There’s something like a
quadrillion libraries - PHP, NodeJS, Python, and couple in Go lang. For
our purposes, we need an easy setup, listening to events and acting,
understanding from the text what kind of task the user requires, and even
more (cron tasks for reminders, incoming web hooks, DB layer, etc.).
Sounds a bit daunting, no? You’re right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to write the first task, I saw that analyzing the text is more than
just matching a function to the text. When there are a lot of tasks,
the code will get long and messy. And that’s why I created Nuntius: a PHP
framework based on Symfony components that helped me organize the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-nuntius&quot;&gt;Introducing Nuntius&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuntius.xyz&quot;&gt;Nuntius&lt;/a&gt; is well-documented, let’s see how
easy is to set up a task. After
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuntius.xyz/Nuntius_Slack_Bot.html&quot;&gt;settings up nuntius&lt;/a&gt; we need to
write the first task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hooks-event-dispatching&quot;&gt;Hooks? Event dispatching?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No and no. To make things easy, Nuntius does not use hooks or events
dispatching to integrate with custom code. Instead, all of the integrations
defined in a YML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hooks.local.yml&lt;/code&gt; we will add a custom task:
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/8b6f57d49281352b6f5217c902d2c023.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our task will be located at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;src/Custom/LookForAPicture.php&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/2bf556c2994b0bc89bc5ede26605f366.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After implementing the task, we can start to code. So, what should this task
do? Get a keyword, look for an image which relates to that keyword, and send it
as an attachment to the message. When you are feeling down you could ask for a
picture of a cute kitten to take away your sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will need to search for pictures via a REST request. I found a nice service
for that: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com&quot;&gt;pixabay&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll need to register and get an
API key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After acquiring the access token, we need to store it somewhere. The best place
would be in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credentials.local.yml&lt;/code&gt; which located under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;settings&lt;/code&gt;
library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/53be42b81314186a5e308cb8fad3cad3.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the code to get the picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/d648637cf5518ab3f5e06dec704d2621.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do is to return the image URL, and that’s it! This the full
 code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/94a3fbae852dbbfa26c0bbfe20436472.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/nuntius-bot/bad_kitten_image.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      An embedded kitten image.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-wait-theres-more&quot;&gt;But Wait, There’s More!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack was kind and embedded the picture for us, but it’s not the best
practice. Using attachments makes the
message much more readable and gives us this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/nuntius-bot/good_kitten_image.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Attaching an image by Slack best practice.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is a bit more complex than the simple URL we returned:
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/b872dccfb12c01cbd2fa080c27fd281b.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;external-services&quot;&gt;External Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind was blown, I know. But what’s next? If you thought that this branch of
development is left without any SAAS solution, you are wrong. Bots need to
interact with people and require deep learning and natural language analysis.
There are two famous players in the market (for now) -
&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.ai&quot;&gt;api.ai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wit.ai&quot;&gt;wit.ai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, they will give you informative object to interact
with and train with deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-that-the-end&quot;&gt;Is That the End?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Skynet is not around the corner, and HAL 9000 isn’t going to be in NASA’s
new spaceships. This is just the beginning. Unless you are a big company like
Apple, Google, or Facebook you probably won’t provide a solution like Siri and
other bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bots, as I can see it, will be another interaction with the product and can
provide a simple way to get information like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When are you going launch the new version?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let users know that the site is under maintenance for now, and when it’s back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notify the user when a new season of a TV show is going to launch (I was
informed about Silicon Valley new season via Facebook Messenger.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget that QA was once done pretty much manually. Now, QA is automated but still
need to be written and maintained. We might be killing one field but creating a
new field.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Travis and WDIO - Breaking out of the Black Box</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Chances are that you already using Travis or another Cool CI to execute your tests. Very often getting boolean or textual output from the execution is enough, because knowing which tests are failing is a good starting point to start to debug the problematic code. In our case, with WebdriverI/O (WDIO) and with an architecture where the frontend and backend are decoupled, it’s much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be that the browser could not click on an element, or the frontend could not contact the backend, or the frontend has a runtime error (well, you might be faced with it, but at Gizra we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;, where it is practically impossible). Who knows, even the browser could crash due to lack of memory - the same applies to Travis too. One solution is to manually start reproducing what Travis does. It’s fun the first time, but doing it again and again is just a waste of time. But recently, our CTO, Amitai gave excellent pointers about dockerized Selenium and insisted that having video recordings is much better than simple static screenshots - and it was so true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days at Gizra - on client projects - we can benefit by knowing exactly how and why our browser-based tests failed. The fact that we already used &lt;a href=&quot;/content/docker-travis-ci/&quot;&gt;Docker inside Travis&lt;/a&gt; helped a lot, but this additional video recording on the browser-based test makes the life of the developers much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s overview what’s bundled into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter&quot;&gt;Drupal Elm Starter&lt;/a&gt;, and who is responsible for what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon a push, GitHub invokes Travis to start a build, that’s just the standard for many projects on GitHub for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Travis executes a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/.travis.yml#L9&quot;&gt;shell scripts&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Build-Matrix&quot;&gt;build matrix&lt;/a&gt;. The only noteworthy thing is that using the build matrix with environment variables can be used to test the things in parallel - like one element of the matrix is the WDIO test, and another element could be any kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)&quot;&gt;Lint&lt;/a&gt; to scrutinize the code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this point, we only focus on one element of the build matrix. Docker Compose &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/docker\_files/docker-compose.yml&quot;&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; two containers, one with the application and the test code, the other with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zalando/zalenium&quot;&gt;Selenium Grid&lt;/a&gt;. It also helps the containers talk to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/&quot;&gt;each other&lt;/a&gt; via expressive hostnames.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WDIO executes our test suites, but the Selenium host is not localhost, but rather the address of the other Docker container. This way Zalenium is able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zalando/zalenium#using-it&quot;&gt;record a video&lt;/a&gt; of the WDIO tests, it hosts the browser, the Selenium Grid and ffmpeg to encode the movie on-the-fly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Drive hosts the videos of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/test_server.sh#L77&quot;&gt;failed tests&lt;/a&gt;. To use Google Drive programmatically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/server/README.md#google-drive-integration&quot;&gt;several steps&lt;/a&gt; are needed, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive&quot;&gt;gdrive&lt;/a&gt; uploader tool has excellent documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the very end, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra-robot&quot;&gt;Gizra Robot&lt;/a&gt; posts a comment on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/ci-scripts/test_server.sh#L94&quot;&gt;conversation thread of the pull request&lt;/a&gt;. Adding a robot user to GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-user-and-organization-accounts/&quot;&gt;is not different&lt;/a&gt; from adding a human - you can create a new GitHub user and dedicate it to this purpose. The exact process is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/blob/master/server/README.md#github-integration&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-result&quot;&gt;The result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an example video of the test on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/pull/93#issuecomment-298260575&quot;&gt;recent pull request&lt;/a&gt;. The icing on the cake is that if you receive the GitHub notification email to your GMail inbox, you can launch a video straight from there via a YouTube player!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Gizra three months ago, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegizraway.com/&quot;&gt;Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt;’s time-box/escalation system helped a lot to accomplish this task, where many layers of the CI stack were new to me. Needless to say, debugging Travis is hard. And then, you need to wait. And wait. A lot. Then your issue has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/issues/83&quot;&gt;timebox&lt;/a&gt; on it, so hard things must be done quickly and by following best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems impossible, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is that this rigorous workflow helped me to find creative ways to solve the problems (not talking about ugly hacks here - just merely changing the way to find proper solutions), if the complexity is adequately calibrated to the developer, it triggers good stress that helps in problem solving too and contributes to the work satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how I was led to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dissect-steps&quot;&gt;Dissect steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be obvious that you need to break the problem into smaller chunks, but when the testability is so problematic, you must follow this principle very strictly. In this case, the most helpful was to test the different units in the simplest environment as possible. For instance there’s a Bash script that’s responsible for the GitHub upload. Instead of launching the script via Travis or via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Running-a-Container-Based-Docker-Image-Locally&quot;&gt;similar local environment&lt;/a&gt;, in the native local environment, just feeding the script with the proper environment variables, what Travis would do, helped to speed up the process to almost real time debuggability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a small Bash construct can be extracted and tested separately. Same for a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; invocation that posts a comment on GitHub. So in the end, I enjoyed the efficiency that came from the way of testing all the things with the minimally needed context - without all the hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-easy-troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Invest in easy troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a strong sign that we wanted to invest a significant amount to have this functionality at our project template, at Elm Starter, just to help future work. Similarly on the low level, it was mandatory at some point to be able to SSH into the Travis build. It’s enabled for private repositories, but in our case, it was mandatory to write to Travis support and this way, for our public repository, it was possible to use this functionality. It helped a lot to understand why the process behaves differently than at the local environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contributing-what-you-can&quot;&gt;Contributing what you can&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the implementation, there were some issues with Zalenium, the side container, which provided Selenium Grid and the video recording (https://github.com/zalando/zalenium/pull/92). It got merged to upstream after 12 days, mostly the time the maintainer waited for my answer. It is just a little documentation fix, but it might save fellow developers frustration. On my side, I had the confirmation from the most capable person that I should not try to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--abort-on-exit&lt;/code&gt; with that container. Such scenarios reinforces the best practice, give back what you have, either it is knowledge, a patch or a full-blown solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaway&quot;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution that is publicly available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter/tree/master/ci-scripts&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; is easy to re-use in any project that has a similar browser-based test, the only criteria is that it should support the execution on a Selenium Grid. You might capture videos of your pure Simpletest, Behat, WDIO or Nightwatch.js (and who knows what kind of other test frameworks are out there in the wild) test suite and port this code from Drupal Elm Starter to easily understand why your test fails, the only criteria is that you should be able to execute Zalenium Docker container aside. Pull requests are more than welcome to make the process more robust or even sleeker!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transcript of a lightning session: Why Drupal?</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is a translation of the transcript of the lightning talk I gave during &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.drupalcamp.es/&quot;&gt;DrupalCamp Spain 2017&lt;/a&gt; in Madrid. The title of the talk was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.drupalcamp.es/sessions/why-drupal-davidbaltha&quot;&gt;Why Drupal&lt;/a&gt;” and talked about my personal reasons for developing with Drupal. You can find the slides, with the transcript in Spanish &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/david_hernandez/why-drupal/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/why-drupal.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Why Drupal?
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-drupal&quot;&gt;Why Drupal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all agree that Drupal is a great tool. In our daily jobs we use Drupal because we think it gives us an advantage over our competitors; because it suits the needs of the clients; because it speeds-up our development; because we produce a high quality product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as programmers, why do we choose to work with a company that uses Drupal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know why you choose to use Drupal, but in this session, I will tell you why I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before jumping to the conclusions, let’s start from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/about-me.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      About me
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am David Hernández and for me, it is a privilege to be here, sharing this lightning talk with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/privilege.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Privilege
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for a company that allowed me to come today to this conference, instead of spending it working. And they pay me well enough to be able to afford spending 3 days in Madrid without trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born to a family that allowed me to finish my studies, and to live abroad to continue my training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a country that has one of the best passports in the world for traveling and most of the borders are open for me with no trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour of my skin makes it that in most places, everybody is helpful and mindful. A colour that does not make me a suspect by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gender doesn’t cause people to question why I have not settled yet, and why I do not yet have a family and children. My gender always helped me to find good jobs and better conditions than the fifty percent of the population of my country, under the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/problem-of-privilege.png)&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      The problem of privilege
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this continues forever. And it is a problem. But does it have a solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there is a really simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/end-of-privilege.png)&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      The end of privilege
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end privilege. But, as this is extremely complicated, we need to continue moving in that direction in little steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have more privileges than the other person? If so, then I have to use those privileges to help them and to help the rest of the people who also lack this privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there people abusing their privilege? If so, then I have to confront them, even if their abuse does not directly affects me or even if it helps me, to stop the abuse of the less privileged people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we gain something before another person, we need to ask ourselves why did we receive it. Was it because we had more merits, or was it because we have more privileges? We have to make the differences of privileges more visible so people are aware of those differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… How is all of this related to Drupal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/free-software.png)&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Free Software
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is the Free / Libre Software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free Software allows anyone to use it - with no exception. But it is not only limited to use - it also allows anyone to study, modify, distribute, or even sell the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four liberties of Free Software allows us to fight against the big companies trying to establish a monopoly. A monopoly that prevents people with less resources or from other countries to use their software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promoting the use of Free Software we help people with less privileges to use a software that will help them reduce the weight of the privilege difference. We allow small companies to access high quality software that is normally only accessible to big corporations that can afford those kind of developments from scratch. And in this way, we help those small companies or companies from country “less” developed to compete with bigger and more powerful companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use our privileged position to help the rest of the world to access those tools more easily. Let’s give them more tools and more power. Let’s contribute code. Let’s spread the use of Free Software. Let’s complain when we are forced to use a private software when a free / libre alternative exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/why-drupal/drupal.png)&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Drupal
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the reason I use Drupal. And also the reason I use Apache, MySQL, PHP, Firefox, Linux, Vim, Elm, LibreOffice and so many more tools. That’s the reason I always ask or look for a free / libre alternative before being forced to use a private solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all of those reasons I want a more inclusive Drupal community, where there is room for any kind of person, even if they do not think like me. Because all these different people help me see the privileges I have and this knowledge, helps me fight to soften those differences on privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all those reasons I want a community where there is no one who is above other member of the community. Where someone with more privilege can impose their decisions over people with less privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Internal Email - as Post</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Below you will find an internal letter I’ve sent to to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;all@gizra.com&lt;/code&gt; a day before this blog post was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve seen more then once companies that share in a transparent way some story. It’s always about something really good (or the illusion of it as “good”), such as unlimited vacation days. Or something really bad, mostly known as “Post Mortem” for after a major screw up. Like leaking all the passwords of a site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember reading one that is about a mediocre state. That is, a state of something that is mostly working, but it’s not optimal – in fact it’s a good few levels below it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty clear why it’s not done, although the more I’ve been thinking about it, I came to realize that it’s those mediocre state that most companies share. And that actually, sharing the below email could help others more than tooting our own horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong. If you ever heard me talk about Gizra, you know I think highly of us, and we have a long resume to prove it. But that only made writing this post even more exciting.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not even about putting myself out of my comfort zone (because I’m not). It’s because a life long experience of doing things slightly different showed me it (usually) leads to good and surprising things. Sometimes it just blows up in your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is the letter in full. I’ve changed the clients name for obvious reasons (but tried to give them a more descriptive context), otherwise the email is un-touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;“Women are incapable of solidarity.” I bet you’ve heard this once or twice in your life, especially in an office environment. I want to refute this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I am guilty of believing this sentiment. I felt it growing up. I was a “tomboy”. I mostly hung out with my male cousins and my brother. For me it was easier - I thought it meant no drama, no hidden intentions, no judgement - just blunt-in-your-face attitude. I luckily did not skip all together on the opportunity to bring wonderful women into my life. It just meant that I handpicked my girlfriends. Those that survived my aggressive filtering, still remain my girlfriends until this day and I can’t imagine how my life would have looked like without them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;

      One of the guys
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started working at Gizra, there was only one other female employee in the office. I was kind of relieved - I was in a familiar environment. A year ago, Amitai challenged this with a &lt;a href=&quot;/content/job-post-goes-viral/&quot;&gt;facebook post&lt;/a&gt; that ended-up going viral. In the job posting, he talked about wanting more diversity - especially women - in our company. His words made me think. Feel. He nudged me out of my comfort zone. It left me curious (and nervous) to find out how this will change our office environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in this discomfort, I understood that Gizra is not typical for its views about diversity. I felt grateful and kept thinking to myself, how is it even possible that more people don’t know this about Gizra? How often do you hear of a company that wants diversity, wants women because they know it will make their company even better!? A company that knows that you have a &lt;strong&gt;family life&lt;/strong&gt; outside of work and it’s not a dirty word.
A company that understands that if you want to have a &lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt;, your &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt; are not an obstacle. A recent example - my son had to stay home from school this week so I took him to the office. While I was caught up with my work, I realized that it was too quiet and immediately went out in pursuit, because everybody knows that &lt;em&gt;kids + quiet = trouble!&lt;/em&gt;  To my relief, I found him happily eating lunch with Amitai and the rest of the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Lunch time!
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that viral post, and in a matter of a year there are now five of us, all working mothers, that hold key positions - Account Manager, QA specialist, Employee Training &amp;amp; Development, Business Development Director, and Operations Manager. The wonderful part of it is that I’ve never been in a workplace that felt so natural to be one of “the girls”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really look forward to those days that all of the women are in the office - to share failures, wins, worries, and celebrations. We are friends. We are professional co-workers. We have each other’s back. We support and encourage each other. We are happy for the other’s successes. We help move the company forward, and there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. These ladies makes me a better person, a better mother, a better woman!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gizra, we always ask how we can do it better. This is doing it better, and we still have a way to go.  We understand very well the importance of &lt;strong&gt;“fit”&lt;/strong&gt; with our clients and this is also true for potential employees. So yes. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you just need to be in a place so special that it fits&lt;/strong&gt;. So, if you are looking for a fit and this sounds right to you, you can apply. And if you are a woman, you are (more than) welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;apply!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You See from Here, You Can't See from There</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;A few days ago I took part in an experience that is rather rare in most workplaces. I was invited to shadow Amitai, the CTO, and co-owner of Gizra, for a full day, in order to understand how things work from his perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impressions of this day are varied, but most importantly I understood things that I would not have learned if not going through this experience. In the end, I feel that I had one of the more interesting experiences and lessons a workplace can offer its employees. It didn’t only enhance me professionally but also opened my mind on how to approach daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Amitai took the time to explain his thoughts and actions, to make his line of thought clear. The idea of allowing employees to sit by and watch the day-to-day activities of the manager, to encourage employees to review and then conduct a genuine and honest conversation, and finally providing answers to difficult questions, are all indications of a real desire to improve, and create an open process with employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All types of feedback are accepted, so even Amitai can improve. In fact, one of the special things for me in this experience is that even writing the negative feedback &lt;em&gt;publicly&lt;/em&gt; is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      It's all from above
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;managers-do-not-know-everything&quot;&gt;Managers Do Not Know Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first task I got to observe, was to prepare the technical description and price estimate for a badly defined RFP. We could have easily been discouraged, and run around in circles answering the technical questions and trying to estimate the time and effort.  The beautiful thing I saw was the self-trust Amitai showed.  He knew there was a better way to provide a fixed price offer based on very little information, and with some effort, he figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting your abilities isn’t less important than knowledge. It makes sure you don’t give up and reminds you to follow your gut feeling in pursuit of trying to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/what-you-see-from-here/against-the-nature.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Against the nature
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;articulate-the-problem&quot;&gt;Articulate the Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized how important it is to invest effort early on in understanding a task before it is to performed.  It helps take on in advance problems that might show up later in the task. And knowing &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to ask is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize disruptions, it is important to come prepared with a precise and clearly formulated question. The answer to your question should ideally be binary. Something like “yes, you are in the right direction” or “No, because this and that”. If the answer isn’t one of these possibilities, you probably did not go over the task properly. Remember, “Managers do not know everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-feel-today&quot;&gt;How I Feel Today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After shadowing, we are requested to prepare a report. And possibly a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using written words to describe my thoughts is definitely out of my comfort zone. In fact, I feel that the pictures I took and scattered in the post may better reflect what I’m trying to convey. However, having to do this forces me to go through a process that I feel contributed a lot to the way I look at things, here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the turning points I had in Gizra was when my role changed from developer to a QA specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Amitai, “What do I need to do in order to succeed in this role?”, and his response was “you should be excellent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a horrible answer. It seemed to me like he was actually saying: “this is the position, good luck and bye!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I still hold my criticism about how that question was answered, I must admit that after this experience I understand that he actually meant what it said. That is, no matter what task you are given, truly try to be excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-my-friends-think-of-it&quot;&gt;What My Friends Think of It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days after this experience, I met some of my friends and one of them asked me what’s new at my workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared with them what I’ve been through and I noticed that all of them were hypnotized. It was completely puzzling for them - how could it be that I got to sit with one of the company owners, and was asked to write criticism about him. And not only was it accepted by him, but he actually encouraged me and guided me to write a post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friend who asked the most questions is an owner of a business in the fashion industry in Israel and has a few shops around the globe. She was amazed by this process, and immediately told me she is going to embrace this idea and start doing it at her business. I was so happy that I was able to share my experience and even provide inspiration to people regardless of their field of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Shadowed Our CTO for a Day, and This Is What I Learned</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Most of software development is about solving problems. For some time now, I have been trying to work out whether there is a formula or strategy that can be taught about how to solve a problem. In pursuit of an answer, I cleared my day and shadowed Amitai, Gizra’s CTO, for a few good hours - hoping to learn something from it - and it was fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the day Amitai was busy writing code in Elm. I don’t (yet) know Elm so I understood very little of the code, but the truth is, it didn’t matter - because I learned a lot about his way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I’ve found an answer to how to solve a problem, but I certainly recognize some characteristics that are needed to become a better developer: great work processes, the right attitude, and staying humble. And because what I love most is to teach others what I have learned, here are my observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;without-shortcuts&quot;&gt;Without Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work in an orderly manner. Take small, but correct, steps. Focus on one thing, and don’t jump from one place to another. If you must leave a loose end, record it so you can easily go back at a later time.  Write organized code with clear hierarchies, using clear names for variables and functions. Do not be stingy with comments to explain what the code does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recording&quot;&gt;Recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document every step you take in GitHub, even if you are the only one working on the project, and no one else is going to read it. The documentation forces you to constantly be aware of your steps, and if you get lost, you can always go back and check what you have already tried and what you didn’t yet get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write in a way that everyone can understand. Watching Amitai doing a code review helped me appreciate how hard it is to go inside another developer’s mind. Be kind, explain clearly what you did, attach screenshots when you submit a Pull Request - it makes life so much easier for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-believe-yourself&quot;&gt;Don’t Believe Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you know you are a good developer, you can’t trust yourself without checking your work. Check your code again and again - see with your own eyes that the code is doing what you expect it to. Do this for small pieces of code, so it will be easier to identify where the problem is if the code does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-panic-get-discouraged-when-things-do-not-work&quot;&gt;Don’t Panic (Get Discouraged) When Things Do Not Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems are part of the journey and you need to believe that you can solve them. While Amitai was struggling with the code, I heard him say over and over sentences like “We will be there soon” and “Believe me we will reach the end … “. This is a sharp contrast to the usual sentences many of us easily say to ourselves: “This is not going well.”, “This is too difficult for me.”, or “I’m not good enough for this task.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit there were moments I thought he should have turned for help. I was very impressed by the fact that he didn’t even mention this options - it was clear he was going to figure it out. Guess what? In the end, he succeeded solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dare-to-start-over-again&quot;&gt;Dare to Start over Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to be good - the best we can.&lt;br /&gt;
You worked hard, invested time and thought, but you’re not happy with what came out? Do you think you can do it better? Do not be afraid to throw everything out, and start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times it is not clear about how to approach a problem, but sometimes you just need to start. Then, you learn that you are on the wrong path. In such a case, you have to be brave to admit it, and bold to choose a new path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what needs to be done - without looking back, without regret about the time spent, without getting stuck on the previous path just because you already went there. Always keep an open mind, be willing to try and make a mistake, this is the best way to learn and grow. This is what success is made of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-glad-to-get-comments-its-free&quot;&gt;Be Glad to Get Comments, It’s Free!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one likes to get bad comments, and it may be frustrating to get them for every little thing, but I think it is necessary. If you want to be the best, this is something that you should not compromise on. This is a wonderful opportunity to get better, and I think people should be thankful that someone has taken the time to review their code carefully and write comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I watched Amitai, I noticed that he wrote detailed and accurate comments (which I very much appreciate), but on the other hand, his compliments were general and only contained one or two words or just an icon. I brought this to his attention, because I believe that when someone does something well, they need to hear specific positive feedback to feel valued for their efforts. When it is warranted, there is no need to save on good words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is an area Amitai has the chance to improve himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was saying, comments are a gift you should take with both hands! You also should enjoy the compliments. Did you receive positive feedback? Read it at least twice - it’s satisfying and you earned it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, it was inspiring and an amazing learning experience to watch another person work. I highly recommend everyone do it at least once. Choose a good developer, ask to be their shadow for a few hours, come curious, ask them to verbalize what they are doing, take a good look, pay attention to the details, ask questions, write notes to yourself. I promise - you will learn a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Data and Our Commit[ment]</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;My introduction to open source was a little unusual - it started around the discussion of open data instead of open code. I got involved in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hasadna.org.il/en&quot;&gt;The Public Knowledge Workshop&lt;/a&gt;,” a non-profit organization of Israeli social activists devoting their leisure time to making public data available and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founding story of this volunteer community impressed me - and even  more so, their social impact. It began with a university student contemplating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/The-info-is-there-but-who-can-figure-it-out-349934&quot;&gt;who he should vote for in the coming election&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a request for data and statistics to The Knesset (the Israeli parliament) spokesperson and received a standard reply with a reference to the official website. Back then, the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041214013530/http://knesset.gov.il/main/heb/home.asp&quot;&gt;mainly consisted of static protocols&lt;/a&gt;. It meant that he had to devote months to skimming and reading hundreds of pages to answer each of the questions he was curious about. Here is where the story becomes interesting - to speed up the process and have the information he needed before election time, he wrote scripts to mine and aggregate the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good open source story, he found that many others had the same “itch”. They created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/projects/open-knesset/&quot;&gt;Open Knesset website&lt;/a&gt;, which became the leading instrument for gathering updated and archival information about the Knesset. The site never intended to replace, nor compete, with the official website. The purpose was to demonstrate how public data can be presented in a way that can be meaningful to citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more great stories like this all around the globe. You can find something that may interest you by choosing a field of interest at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opengovguide.com/report-builder/&quot;&gt;opengovguide report generator&lt;/a&gt;. These stories teach of the essence of public open data: the effort to redesign relationships between citizens and governments, especially in an era where the cost of data required to make decisions costs as much as (or less than) a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/items/?_nkw=rubber+ducks&amp;amp;_sacat=&amp;amp;_ex_kw=&amp;amp;_mPrRngCbx=1&amp;amp;_udlo=&amp;amp;_udhi=&amp;amp;_sop=12&amp;amp;_fpos=&amp;amp;_fspt=1&amp;amp;_sadis=&amp;amp;LH_CAds=&amp;amp;rmvSB=true&quot;&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that open source developers should get involved and take part in efforts like these for two main reasons. First, I believe that dealing with open data challenges make you a better developer. They tend to improve critical and creative thinking and force us to focus on the end users and user stories. Secondly, it is a great way to utilize your professional skills for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideas.ted.com/how-open-government-data-creates-smarter-societies&quot;&gt;a better society&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, descent data is crucial, even if you believe we just entered “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016&quot;&gt;the post truth era&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-data-to-public-open-data&quot;&gt;From data to public open data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking of public data, just like with any code, you should ask yourself “how do I want it to be presented”:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question is whether we expect the data producer/collector to present it as a solid manufactured product, or should the client (or user) have the right (and ability) to reshape and reuse it. Another way to put it is - who actually owns the data, and do they have the right to limit the usage of the data? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://opengovdata.org/&quot;&gt;principles of governmental open data&lt;/a&gt; that were defined in a workshop consisting of 30 open government advocates back in 2007, have since been adopted and recognized by state organizations. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete (Bring it all, not just a part or parts of it).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary (Publicize it as it was collected, granular as possible).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Timely (Provide it ASAP, since time influences the data’s usability and value).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessible (Consider the means of distribution to enable as many as possible to use the data).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine Processable (Make it usable, not only readable).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-discriminatory (Make it available to all, without any demand to register).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-proprietary (Neither the content nor the format should be limit users).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;License-free (Except for some reasonable privacy, security, and privilege restrictions. These words may make you yawn, but actually it is one of the most tumultuous debates.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the original principles of the open data definition, but of course, like any other open source project, they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendefinition.org/participate/&quot;&gt;dynamic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/&quot;&gt;forked&lt;/a&gt;, and have &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/&quot;&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;got-it-so-where-do-i-start&quot;&gt;Got it, so where do I start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out what is happening in your country, region, municipality, or in any other place of interest. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatabarometer.org/&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Foundation’s Barometer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://index.okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge’s Global Open Data Index&lt;/a&gt;) are beneficial resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search relevant open source code repositories, and look for open issues that fit your development skill.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resist the temptation to start by building your own project - most likely someone already thought about a solution for the problem you face. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opengovguide.com/report-builder/&quot;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt; and consider joining those efforts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; can help you connect with active groups in your region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embrace the opportunity to learn and gain experience. Don’t expect quick results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Next in Nonprofits Podcast: Open Source, CMS, and Web Project Planning</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to speak with Steve Bolan at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextinnonprofits.com&quot;&gt;Next in Nonprofits&lt;/a&gt; about nonprofit organizations doing technology planning and outreach using open-source tools and working with content management systems and planning. Having been in nonprofit work for the better part of this decade and the last, it was interesting to reflect in my current role (as a CTO in a for profit agency) with my past brain (as a nonprofit executive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun conversation that wandered onto many topics in nonprofit tech (the value of open source, &lt;a href=&quot;/#gizra-way&quot;&gt;The Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt;, and user design and interaction), the bottom line to which is that we need to think about our users first and our technology second when it comes to building web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the podcast below, or over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextinnonprofits.com/2016/11/gizra/&quot;&gt;Next in Nonprofits site&lt;/a&gt;, along with a host of other great podcasts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Talking from a Phone Booth: Strategies for Working Remotely</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I am sure you have noticed that the era of public telephone booths is coming to an end. On the NYC streets there are only four remaining public phone booths - waiting there for Superman to change his costume, or more likely to  give a homeless person a break from the cold. I wouldn’t bother to note this striking revelation except that recently I have begun a tight personal relationship with a phone booth and it’s not that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.798488,-73.9708797,3a,75y,331.88h,66.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sA4uG2WJ2hYS7mpq2EPwO7g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&quot;&gt;remaining relic&lt;/a&gt; a few blocks from my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my work days start inside a booth, sitting in a small dark cell, speaking with someone from Gizra HQ, located across the ocean from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-we-mentioned-our-us-office-before&quot;&gt;Have we mentioned our US office before?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizra expanded to what some people say is the greatest city in the world, operating from a co-working space in Manhattan – a space where the booth I speak about is located. The booth provides privacy and is also the right place to go in such an environment, when taking a phone call or meeting. I doubt that the guy I am sharing a power strip with cares to hear me speaking about Drupal modules, NYC tax breaks for startups, or Brice’s daughter’s ear infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/phone-booth/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      This is what Gizra's USA NYC office looks like.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the total 20+ Gizra team, there has been increasingly more of us working remotely. Some of us are in Israel but live far away (well, relativity) from the city of Tel Aviv, and others, are on different continents altogether. It has been a real challenge for all of us -  those that work remotely, and for those that work from desks at the main office - to not be strangers to each other, and  to feel that we are part of the same team, sharing the same culture, visions, values, and even internal jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to go back to the phone booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;co-working-space-practices-the-gizra-way&quot;&gt;Co-working space practices, The Gizra Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After few months here, I came up with the &lt;a href=&quot;/#gizra-way&quot;&gt;Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt; practices for co-working spaces. This is not one of those “Do not steal someone else’s food from the fridge.” or “Don’t bring stinky meals” lists. If you don’t know that, then you should look for a basic etiquette class. Do those still exist? Anyways…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time box your day (and put your headphones on)&lt;/b&gt; : When working by yourself without anyone around to interrupt you, it’s easy to be carried away and not notice that you have been researching hotels for an upcoming trip to DC for more than hour now. Fix a time period for every task in order to put boundaries on the task so that you don’t need to skip lunch (see #2).  I use a timer that alerts me every 25 min, and encourages me to take quick mental breaks. In Gizra, we use our own grassroots system to log in project contribution hours, we call it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/productivity&quot;&gt;Productivity&lt;/a&gt;. Why the headphones? This is the open space equivalent for “do not disturb” sign. If your co-space neighbors do not know that, move to a different desk or a different space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Do not eat at your desk/laptop: &lt;/b&gt; Go out for lunch, and if the weather permits, eat outside. Packing your own lunch or ordering in? Take a real break from work and your screen, and have it in the common area. You won’t be sitting there by yourself for too long, and that person sitting next to you might be someone who is looking for your expertise, or can help you on a project that you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Investment in community:&lt;/b&gt; One of Gizra’ core values is contributing to Open Source projects. Treat the co-working space as your community and find ways to share your knowledge or expertise with your peers: mentorship program, seminars, free tips, and if you feel very happy - throw a happy hour event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Step out of your comfort zone:&lt;/b&gt; and go to a happy hour event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Pack your stuff and go home (or to the nearest bar):&lt;/b&gt; Finish your work day at a reasonable time. We don’t believe 14 hours work days are more efficient. In fact, it’s most likely less efficient, so even if your neighbors are working late, you should leave to be fresh tomorrow. If you do not have your own friends, family, or hobbies - exercise # 4 and drag the amigos along with you to the nearest watering hole.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Just be kind: &lt;/b&gt; Basic decency rules of life don’t change according to where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Yeah, use the phone booth for your phone and Skype calls:&lt;/b&gt;  it is a throwback to the good old days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Elm from a Business Perspective</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Elm, like any rising open source project, is getting both positive endorsements and negative critiques. Reading the good ones, is always fun; but the negative ones are just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I came across this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/elm-is-wrong&quot;&gt;Elm Is Wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and realized that I’ve always read the good and bad critiques from a &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; point of view, but I have yet to read about what it means from a &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can assure you it’s a different perspective. One that is about dollars and the cost of bugs - not about “type classes” or “higher kinded types.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let’s Talk about Decoupled Authentication</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;For a traditional Drupal site, we don’t need to handle
authentication, because Drupal has our back - a user submits the login form,
gets a cookie, and starts using the awesome site. But what about decoupled sites?
How can we authenticate the user?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into this, we need to understand the authentication types
provided by RESTful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cookie - Validating the user cookie is not something new for us. We have
  been doing it for years, and it’s one of the first techniques web developers
  acquire. But, to validate the request we need to pass a CSRF token. This token
  helps &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RESTful-Drupal/restful/blob/b5f717945081be3f1aa22968f140a3b6d056fea1/src/Plugin/authentication/CookieAuthentication.php#L49&quot;&gt;make sure&lt;/a&gt; the form was not a fraud. An
  example could be a form that tweets on the behalf of us on Twitter.
  The existence of a valid CSRF in the request would make sure an internet scam could
  not generate the form and upload to Twitter a photo of a cat, when you’re a
  dog person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access token - RESTful will generate an access token and bind it to the
  user. Unlike the cookie which needs a CSRF token to be valid by Restful, we
  get a two-for-one deal. The existence of the access token in the DB is
  verified and references us to the user which is represented by that access
  token.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Play Rugby in the meeting room? Thoughts about employee training program</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;It all started when I came across an ongoing Gizra calendar event with the title ‘Scrum’.
I didn’t know the word and I wasn’t invited to these meetings. But it was something unfamiliar, and my curiosity piqued.
So I used Google Translate, but the result I got did not make any sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/thoughts-about-training/scrum_google_translate.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Translate, as any native non-English speaker knows, is not precise and sometimes translates words in funny ways, but this was too much. What was going on in the meeting room?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/thoughts-about-training/rugby_scrum.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, because I didn’t hear strange noises from the room, and didn’t see anybody walking around dressed like rugby players, I realized that I was probably missing something.&lt;br /&gt;
So I asked the father of Google Translate - Google itself.   Things were starting to make sense and I was fascinated.&lt;br /&gt;
I found myself rolling from one article to another, reading about the Scrum method with enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to work at Gizra three months ago, I received the title ‘Employee Training &amp;amp; Development’. Even though this was exciting to me - I get excited with anything that has the word ‘training’ in it - I was not really sure what I should do with it. The exposure to the Scrum method helped me think about my role in Gizra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Scrum is based on the Agile methodology - an iterative light-weight approach to software development - and unlike traditional methods, it is built on the premise that it is impossible to think in advance about all the possible scenarios. In a dynamic world, especially when it comes to software development, changes occur all the time: new demands by clients, market changes, new technologies, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;
So the more I read about Scrum, the more I realized that Gizra’s training process needs to also be agile. What we teach today will not necessarily be useful to employees tomorrow, so the training program should be built in a way that is flexible to changes and new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know of many 20+ employee companies that make the decision to invest a full-time role to employee training. Frankly, I don’t know of any.&lt;br /&gt;
For me, it says something very important - Gizra wants to invest in their already great employees to make them even better.&lt;br /&gt;
But how do we get there? This is a question that I still don’t have a full answer for.&lt;br /&gt;
So in the meantime, I will just share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teach-them-to-swim-or-throw-them-in-the-deep-end&quot;&gt;Teach them to swim or throw them in the deep end?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do employees require organized training or should we just show them the pool and let them reveal things for themselves?
In other words, who is responsible for learning, the employee or the trainer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to Gizra, they threw me into the deep end. The water in Gizra is very deep! &lt;br /&gt;
It was a frustrating experience. I know how to swim and I did all the moves, and yet I felt a lot of times that I was drowning. It was a new pool, a different water temperature, and it took time before I learned to take a rest in the shallow water, and where the ladder was located so I could get out.&lt;br /&gt;
To tell you the truth, I’m still learning.&lt;br /&gt;
For a new employee, it is a very inconvenient experience, even stressful, and I admit that sometimes I flirted with the thought of going back to my previous job, familiar and cozy, where I knew how to swim well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kept me going is the very early understanding of “The Gizra Way” that allows you to make mistakes. The message is clear: the important thing is to keep doing, make mistakes and do better next time. I realized that nobody would fire me because I was wrong, as long as I took note of my mistakes, learned from them, and made all the efforts not to do them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organized training plan’s main advantage is that it facilitates the entry process, which is already difficult. It prevents added frustrations and allows for more rapid learning. From the first moment an employee understands what is expected from her, the knowledge is gradually built, and she makes less mistakes. I believe that this significantly shortens the “newbie” time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand this process can create passive workers - they just need to come to class and they will get all the answers.&lt;br /&gt;
When someone is thrown into the deep end, they must be active. Learn the movements on their own. The message is that you have responsibility for your learning. There is value in questioning and self-discovery, and it encourages initiative.&lt;br /&gt;
I think when a person finally figure out something on their own, they get much greater satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the web development world, where things are quickly and constantly changing, this is a very important skill to learn alone. All of this should take place in an environment that demands excellence, but still lets you get it wrong and learn from mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
I found this environment at Gizra and we need to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am still trying to find the right formula that would combine structured learning and independent study.&lt;br /&gt;
What topics are important to teach in class and what should be left for independent study?&lt;br /&gt;
How to encourage curiosity?&lt;br /&gt;
How to create a safe and comfortable atmosphere for self-study? &lt;br /&gt;
How to make frustration a motivator instead of a source of despair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about the good of the company? What is the fastest way to train an employee? How much breathing room does Gizra have to absorb mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-is-our-best-friend&quot;&gt;Google is our best friend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the learning process, it is very important to convey that we should not be afraid to say ‘I don’t know.’ No one expects you to know everything, especially when you are a newbie.&lt;br /&gt;
To be honest, at this point, I am still a newbie myself at Gizra. I feel that there are more things I don’t know than things I do.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, don’t give up on yourself. Not knowing should motivate you to act! Have you heard any concept that you don’t understand? Have you come across a tool that you don’t know what it does? Google it! Keep asking, and don’t stop, until you know.&lt;br /&gt;
Good employees are employees who know their job.&lt;br /&gt;
Excellent employees are employees who know what they don’t know, and continue learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-knows-better-the-teacher-or-the-student&quot;&gt;Who knows better, the teacher or the student?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise we have become accustomed to is that the specialists should teach. Big companies that have organized training department, let experts (external or internal) provide training on topics in which they specialize.&lt;br /&gt;
But what about small companies that have a smaller number of employees and limited resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizra is technology intensive and is constantly searching and adding new and better tools to its stack. People come from all kinds of backgrounds and with different levels of knowledge on various technologies. Therefore, it is clear that there are more than a few topics that employees know better than me, the trainer.&lt;br /&gt;
This point bothered me greatly. At first I thought I should take all the responsibility on the knowledge - the trainer has to know everything about what she has to teach. I quickly realized that even though I really wanted to, I can not know everything. However, whatever I do teach, I teach really well.&lt;br /&gt;
So, I understood that it is important that I have excellent training skills, but still, how do I bridge the knowledge gaps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my far past when I worked in the Education field, before I entered the web development world, I worked in a wonderful place called The Secular Yeshiva. This is a place where secular people learn and take responsibility for setting their Jewish identity.&lt;br /&gt;
One method, that is still with me today, was the ancient Jewish method - Hevruta (learning with partners).&lt;br /&gt;
Hevruta is about learning in small groups (3-5 people), and the idea is that the group is a space where no one has authority over knowledge. Learning occurs during the exchange of ideas and knowledge-sharing among participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if knowledge is also in the workers heads, let’s get it out there and share it with everybody.&lt;br /&gt;
In the pedagogical world, it’s called Peer Learning. In other words, students teaching each other. In this way people are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, the message is that everyone has a responsibility for learning, and to teach. It’s a start of creating a culture of contribution and sharing of knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
How to implement this? Well, I am still thinking about it, promising to update in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-teach&quot;&gt;What to teach?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we be training on technology, or skills and practices?&lt;br /&gt;
Where to start? There is so much to learn and who should know what?&lt;br /&gt;
One of the principles of Scrum is that everyone needs to know everything! This way, everyone can perform any task (characterizing the structure, testing, Front end, Back end, etc.), so if there was a strain on one team, another team can help out.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, project managers, marketers and even customers need to understand the basics of development work, to create a common language for more effective and clear communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to find a way to create a learning program that works for everyone.  We should take into consideration that developers come with a different set of concepts than project managers, and therefore the training should be able to be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, when talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegizraway.com/approach_data_structure_task.html&quot;&gt;How to approach a new task&lt;/a&gt;, developers will be very clear with terms such as query and relationship, but they may have difficulty explaining it in literal terms and go straight to talking in programming language.&lt;br /&gt;
Marketing and project managers would rather easily understand the story, since most of their work is to understand the customer’s needs, but may find it difficult to break it down to entities and identify the relationships between them.&lt;br /&gt;
If we want to create a common language for everyone, we need to understand these differences and consider them during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-a-training-plan&quot;&gt;What about a Training Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, by nature, a very planned person. I am used to working with well defined goals and to release a product only when it is complete. Therefore, my natural tendency was to start work on a training program, and only then begin with training sessions to the employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that didn’t happen. On the second week on the job, I found myself teaching a subject that I just learned a few days earlier. It felt like they threw me into the deep end from a height of an Olympic springboard - it was so high I could hear myself screaming before I hit the water. &lt;br /&gt;
I’m not used to being anything less than an expert on a subject that I teach. I did it but I was not at all convinced that this was the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I came across Scrum and the more I read, the more things fell into place.&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike traditional methods which have detailed documents defining goals and objectives, Scrum has concise lists (backlog) and a lot of face to face interaction with all the people involved. In addition, there is an emphasis on achieving efficacy - how many useful things were created in a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I stayed with my familiar method, it is likely that for the first two months I would have spent on builds a training program, learning content, preparing lessons, and only then started teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
In practice, today, only three months into my new job, I have taught 15 classes on 5 different topics. At this rate, I am excited to see where we will be in a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was my first training session any good? No, and of course it could have been much better if I had more time to study the subject and prepare. But going back to the Scrum model, it was the best training version I could release at that time. I knew I had enough training sessions along the way, so I could improve while doing.&lt;br /&gt;
If I did not jump into the deep end so early, I would probably, only now, be giving the first training session. I may have been more confident standing in front of the class, but moving forward at a much slower pace. Even this post couldn’t be written because I wouldn’t have understood a lot of things I understand now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still hard to shake off old habits and even when I am writing these sentences I find it difficult to release and say, this is a good enough version of the post. There are a lot of open questions, and I still can not fully answer the question: how to set up a training program in a small company.&lt;br /&gt;
But I remind myself to think “scrum” and say: “Let Go! Even in Rugby they don’t stay with their arms interlocked all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jekyll Progressive Web App Starter Kit Generator</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. I think it’s a great tool! But lately I have been hearing a lot about Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - you know the kind of web apps that feel like native apps, with a welcome screen, a shortcut on your phone, offline support, and more. So, I started implementing these new and shiny toys, one by one, on a bunch of static websites I built with Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this endeavor I ran into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit&quot;&gt;Google Web Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt; - “a Boilerplating &amp;amp; Tooling for Multi-Device Development” and even did a couple of Pull Requests there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Google Repo I learned a lot about PWA, and as I was building the features into my static websites, I noticed there weren’t any materials out there about PWA features with Jekyll. I kept hearing the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi in my head telling me “This is not the open-source way! You shouldn’t keep this knowledge to yourself”. So here it is - the &lt;strong&gt;Jekyll Starter Kit&lt;/strong&gt; generator.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Year in Review - 5 Ways I am Living The Gizra Way</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I joined Gizra exactly a year ago. One of my first tasks was to create a content piece describing The Gizra Way. For me it was all still theory.  Over the past year, working at Gizra has taken me out of my comfort zone and slowly the company’s way of doing things has seeped into my consciousness and taken over in the best possible way.  Here are 5 ways I am living The Gizra Way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am better at using &lt;strong&gt;the Gizra Way filter&lt;/strong&gt;.  In approaching a task, I remember - most of the time - to ask  “Is this the Gizra Way?”  I had to get my hand slapped a few times to internalize this. A silly, but effective example: I opened a document to manage urgent website changes I wanted to implement. Amitai looked at me with eyes that said “Really?” and schooled me in his honest and direct way. I needlessly complicated the process with extra steps and documents. Since then, I have become comfortable with Github and even enjoyed the fact that the “Issues” I open are only a tab away from the “Pull Requests” that are implementing them. I have learned to cut out superfluous steps that would slow implementation, and that includes me speaking Gizra’s common language by using the same tools as the developers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ever-elusive &lt;strong&gt;Work-life balance is not a myth&lt;/strong&gt;.  It always sounded like a nice concept but I never actually saw it implemented beyond a lot of lip-service and some flex-hour initiatives. In Gizra, it comes from top-down led by personal example.  I was even inspired to jot down my &lt;a href=&quot;/content/job-post-goes-viral/&quot;&gt;impressions&lt;/a&gt; about Gizra’s efforts to bring in female employees to round out the development team.  Because personal life is seen as a legitimate priority here, I found myself released from the ongoing stress of hiding my family constraints. I speak freely about my children (I don’t overshare pictures because we all know that kid pictures are really only interesting to their parents).  When the babysitter falls through, I can be honest about my reason for moving a meeting out by an hour.  It’s a relief and the energy I save is funneled into my work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/year-in-review/rachel-gizra.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Work-life balance is not a myth.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made &lt;strong&gt;timeboxing&lt;/strong&gt; personal.  I immediately connected with the idea of fixing a time period for every task in order to set expectation and avoid scope creep.  I have enthusiastically applied it to my personal, already evolved, time management strategy. It is becoming - as I am still a work in process - an amazing way for me to tackle annoying tasks, overcome procrastination, and manage my perfectionism. The angst of an overwhelming task is put at bay by setting a timebox with the purpose of making a dent, rather than the goal of finishing the whole task.  What seems too large to approach, becomes possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a culture of &lt;strong&gt;transparency&lt;/strong&gt;, my only choice was to be myself. It has always amazed me that in Gizra clients can see the developer’s internal communications and actions in Github. They can even see if we mess things up. Gizra goes as far as making public our internal Gitbook documentation that covers sensitive topics like [“Thinking of quitting?”] (https://www.thegizraway.com/thinking_of_quitting.html) My first encounter with this healthy obsession of letting everyone see our warts and all, was when I was asked to share a work in progress - a very, very, very, rough draft. It was uncomfortable because I did not have the chance to bring it up to an acceptable level.  The discussion around the content ended up being very matter of fact and about getting to the final goal. The early input saved me a lot of work and I concentrated my efforts on the right content. Quickly, any sense of facade disappeared and I was forced into an environment that I could only be me. It felt like a significant personal transformation - letting go of the need to show a perfect result in lieu of a better process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterations&lt;/strong&gt; let me keep striving for excellence - all the while failing.  For me, understanding that everything I do is part of a short iteration means that the pressure of not making mistakes is lifted.  There is nothing I can do that will have a horrible impact because it will be evaluated in a short period of time and I will be able to pivot accordingly. The other side of the coin is that nothing that I do is seen as permanent because we will always be looking for a better way of doing things. My personal iteration journey is cracking the marketing strategy in Gizra. I put together a solid marketing plan. My great intentions were met with a major implementation fail. I was not able to push forward the marketing efforts within the organization.  I was using the wrong language and tools. In Gizra style, this effort was considered the first iteration and we are now repeating the process in a second iteration with, hopefully, the right adjustments based on lessons learned. The marketing plan has stayed pretty much the same. The way the tasks are broken down and tracked is completely different. Instead of getting disheartened - OK, there was some of that but I got over it - I am now excited that Gizra’s work ethic demands that we do it again but better this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that the Gizra Way provides relief from useless noise that distracts from the tasks in hand, clearing the path for excellence. The Gizra Way has made me: uncomfortable, be myself, get things done, and always think about how to do things better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web Frameworks, Proof of Concept, and Building an Inbox Simulation</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;baseball-apple-pie-and-web-frameworks&quot;&gt;Baseball, Apple Pie, and Web Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like baseball better than football (the American version). Football is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c&quot;&gt;game of inches&lt;/a&gt; – but it’s measured in yards. Imprecise scope is built into the system. Baseball, on the other hand, is a game of wildly random occurrences that are often measured to the third decimal place. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabr.org/sabermetrics&quot;&gt;entire framework exists&lt;/a&gt; to understand the smallest, yet important, details of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about baseball is what I like about the current state of web applications. There is a growing set of frameworks that allow you to “scratch your own itch” and be precise about your scope in ways that you never could before. I really like going to web conferences, and seeing things like Drupal being used as a backend to serve content to some other front-end framework (enter your favorite: Angular, React, Ember) that can bend, shape, and re-present that content in ways that Drupal never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a web development agency that focuses on complex content management, that has huge – and really exciting – implications for how we do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-major-corporation-to-do&quot;&gt;What’s a Major Corporation To Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example a conversation that started with someone that does training and assessment at a Fortune 50 corporation – one that trains a lot of employees. At some point she asked me “Do you guys do inbox simulations?” I had to think for a second if I even knew what inbox simulation was - and it turns out, it’s exactly what it sounds like: a simulated email inbox to test and assess an employee’s response and prioritization skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first response was “No,” and my second – almost immediate – followup was, “but I don’t see why we couldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem they had was that none of the software they had tried was giving them precisely what they needed. And that’s not surprising. There are more than 500 Learning Management Systems on the market, each with it’s own bloated feature set trying to solve specific use cases with general tools. It’s also not surprising that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capterra.com/learning-management-system-software/user-research&quot;&gt;fewer than 25%&lt;/a&gt; of corporate LMS users are “very satisfied” with their system. Given the large features sets and the likely time it took to get them to market, most of them are probably built on technology that’s already five years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-proof-of-concept&quot;&gt;Enter Proof of Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That conversation led to a “show us what you can do” meeting. This was a problem because, well, we had never done it before. My five-or-six-years-ago brain said to myself, “We can’t possibly create a demo of an inbox simulation – I’ll just put together a slide deck that explains what I’m talking about here with web frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when &lt;a href=&quot;/team/#amitaibu&quot;&gt;Amitai&lt;/a&gt; said, “Let’s create an inbox simulation for your meeting – we can do it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;. Open a repo and I’ll show you how. What should it have?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I answered (dubiously), “Well, it should look and feel like an Outlook inbox, and we should be able to demonstrate that their training logic can be applied to simple email tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You mean like if you respond one way, you get a certain response back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-scaffolding-of-an-inbox&quot;&gt;The Scaffolding of an Inbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; for the project, which at Gizra starts with a stack that includes a location to create static prototype pages served by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and is automatically updated and published by &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://semantic-ui.com/&quot;&gt;Semantic UI&lt;/a&gt; CSS framework is included so that we get all the goodies that come with it and don’t need to recreate the wheel on design elements (we recently switched from Bootstrap, and I already like it a lot better, if not just because our prototypes don’t look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;every Bootstrap website ever&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I wanted three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;inbox&lt;/strong&gt; that looked realistic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; that reflected activity in the inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;admin screen&lt;/strong&gt; that allowed manipulation of the inbox content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the admin screen, because that seemed the least daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/admin-sketch.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      I am a terrible sketch artist, and I often don't carry paper. This was sketched on a napkin from a coffee shop.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the idea, I moved quickly into the static prototype, because my CSS skills dramatically outweigh my drawing skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/admin-prototype.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      That's a little better.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was the inbox itself, and because I wanted it to look like Outlook, we figured we could try to grab the HTML, CSS and JS from an Outlook Online account that I had created for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a ridiculous mess that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes into that task, I realized it would be easier to recreate the inbox from scratch. Semantic UI made it pretty easy.The Font Awesome icons already there, and the fact that it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/&quot;&gt;flexbox&lt;/a&gt; friendly, meant that I had a pretty good static version up in about 4 hours (it could have been faster, but it was my first time really using Semantic UI, and I was trying to follow strict &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbem.com/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt; principles, which we also recently started at Gizra).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/inbox-prototype.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Starting to look like the real thing.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, I made a pull request, and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-it-dynamic-with-elm&quot;&gt;Making it dynamic with Elm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, some strange miracle had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amitai had &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/6&quot;&gt;created a basic Elm app&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/8&quot;&gt;converted my HTML markup to Elm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation/pull/12&quot;&gt;created a basic model for a functioning app&lt;/a&gt;. I had heard Amitai speak and have read about how Elm’s compiler, which catches runtime errors, makes development so much faster, but seeing it in action was pretty amazing. Our conversation on Github:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/github-conversation.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      The Elm is strong with this one.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating that dashboard referenced in the conversation was fairly easy too. Semantic UI has a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html&quot;&gt;nice looking tables&lt;/a&gt; and classes to vary the look enough to get a lot of different options. I found one I liked, filled it with enough dummy data to give it the feel of a real dashboard, and we were all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Amitai created a nifty little delayed response function. If you choose a particular response (in this case, some version of “ignore”), you get a followup email demanding your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-inbox-simulator/delayed-response.gif&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Don't ignore my emails!
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the next day or two refining features, polishing the layout, and replacing the dummy text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I needed to add a few tweaks to the layout, and add sample emails that were more realistic, and some logic that made sense. To do that I had to get into Elm and figure out how it works - in particular how to make it present the HTML syntax I needed. It turns out that was pretty logical and straightforward. I’ve barely scratched the surface, but I’m pretty pleased to have my first few commits on an Elm project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-result&quot;&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/inbox-simulation&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; and try out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://inbox-simulation.gizra.com/&quot;&gt;sample application&lt;/a&gt;, but the final product is a simple response to a complex need. We got there in several days by breaking down a complex problem into small surmountable tasks - a method we call &lt;a href=&quot;/#gizra-way&quot;&gt;The Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, we ignored all other features, even how to permanently store the data – just a simple single page application that shows a realistic inbox with a few features. I never got my admin screen - there wasn’t enough time, and there’s other stuff to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, of course, helped enormously by a robust set of web frameworks that are helping us do web tasks, faster, with greater flexibility, and with a preciseness like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yesod (and Haskell) from a Drupal (and PHP) Perspective</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In Gizra, we run an unusual stack. Drupal, our bread and butter, serves as the backend and is complimented by &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt; for the front end, and as of recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yesodweb.com/&quot;&gt;Yesod&lt;/a&gt; - a Haskell framework.&lt;br /&gt;
Before Yesod, we were running NodeJs as our proxy server for light tasks or real-time messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ever since I came across Elm, Javascript and I are hardly friends. I respect it, but can no longer turn my eye from its shortcomings. Functional programming has caught my heart and mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’m not going to try and present strong points on why &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should adapt this stack, but rather share with you the unique path we are paving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elm&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elm was my first dip into the functional programming (FP) world. I recommend starting from there. It’s way more gentle than Haskell, and it has, of course, one important advantage - it helps you build rock solid, crazily fast, joy-filling, web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/content/faithful-elm-amazing-router/&quot;&gt;post and video&lt;/a&gt; will get you excited as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gentle-intro-to-haskell&quot;&gt;Gentle Intro to Haskell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to start explaining what’s so special about Haskell is to dive directly into Haskell. While PHP is defined (by some) as a “productive” language, Haskell is often blamed (by some) as being an “academic language”. Both statements are probably wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often when mentioning Haskell, we talk about the compiler and the type system. They are truly marvelous tools. For the type system, I think the Elm post I lined above should be enough to get the hang of it. But I’d like to continue and reveal a bit more by highlighting mini examples on how Haskell makes us approach development tasks differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are examples from the REPL (the interactive shell for Haskell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-haskell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have here are two lists of integers that are appended to each other. A list of integers is represented as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; is the operation that causes those two lists to be grouped into a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskell comes with some handy shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating a Dynamic Email Template in Drupal</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Creating a plain text email with Drupal is a simple task. However, when you want to send a nicely designed message with a logo, an article, a linked button or any other unique design with dynamic content personalized for each user, it can get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complication stems not from the dynamic content, but rather from the fact that the CSS that can be applied inside email templates is limited. In general, targeting multiple email clients can be worse then getting your CSS to work on IE9!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will walk you through a solution we use to address these requirements, but before jumping in, let me first explain Gizra’s approach to themes. We don’t use custom CSS in Drupal themes. When we start building a website, we divide our work into several milestones, the first is creating a clean and static markup, using Jekyll. At Gizra, we take pixel perfect very seriously, and by doing the markup first, we can concentrate on building our App pages exactly the way they are suppose to look, test their responsiveness, show our clients a first draft, and fix bugs before getting into the logic. We use gulp to compile the SASS files into one CSS file, and after doing that, we copy the CSS file to the themes folder. Then we take our static pages, cut them into pieces, and use them in Drupal themes and plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this, we can focus on our logic without worrying about how it may look with different dynamic content. Focusing on Frontend and Backend as separate tasks makes building websites easier and faster. Even fixing bugs discovered while implementing dynamic content can now be easily fixed. Our
&lt;a href=&quot;/content/custom-css-as-contrib-with-jekyll/&quot;&gt;No more CSS in your Drupal Theme!&lt;/a&gt; blog post talks more extensively about the way we work with Drupal themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same approach is implemented when we create an email template. We first build the email markup with static content, and then we use it to create dynamic content messages. Oh, and we cheat, because we don’t write a single line of HTML or CSS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>OG8 Development Mindset</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As OG8 is steadily being built, I have noticed a certain pattern - or a mindset - we’ve been following which I think is worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OG8 is the third time I’ve written OG for Drupal. The first OG7 version was a head jump into the Entity goodness that Drupal 7 brought along with Entity API. The second version was taking a small step back away from the Entity fiesta, but took two steps forward into the field API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that as a developer I have matured since then. Edge cases are no longer my concern. I mean, I’m making sure that edge cases can be done and the API will cater to it, but I won’t go too far and implement them. It’s not that in OG7 we tried to tackle all of the edge cases, but in OG8 it’s even less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, although we write a lot of new code as part of the porting, as the way we write modules for Drupal 8 has changed considerably, writing OG8 feels like… Well, it feels like I’m mostly &lt;em&gt;deleting&lt;/em&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Removing lines of code is so much better than adding
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myths-debunked&quot;&gt;Myths Debunked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not too rare to hear rants about OG. Often they are not backed by actual data, or even refer to older versions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time contributing to the Drupal project in different ways, I finally decided to step up and get involved in one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/strategic-initiatives&quot;&gt;Core Initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. I was on IRC when I saw an announcement about the JSON API / GraphQL initiative weekly meeting and it seemed like a great chance to join. So, this blog post is about how you can get involved in a Core Initiative and more specifically, how can you get involved in the JSON API / GraphQL Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elmctron - Build Desktop Apps with Elm and Electron</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I work at Gizra, so it was only a matter of time before Elm infected me as well, and I think it’s growing on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build something a little different, not just the plain old TodoMVC. So, I harnessed every bit of creativity I had and came up with the most radical idea ever - I took the TodoMVC in Elm and got it to work in Electron, and called it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Elmctron&lt;/code&gt; (I know, so creative of me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://electron.atom.io/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; enables you to build cross platform desktop apps with web technologies. So we can take all the goodies we get with Elm and use them in our desktop application. It’s a brand new world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my thought that we should build a couple of gulp tasks to make our life easier - to do the bare minimum because after all, who wants to do more than we he have to? (let’s hope my boss will not read this part)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with that in mind, the only commands I want to run are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone ..&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/code&gt;. The gulp tasks should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compile SASS to css.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compile Elm to JS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch and auto-reload.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automagically download and install elm packages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the electron app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Faithful Elm and the Amazing Router</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/FgaoOgJ5CAU&quot;&gt;I gave&lt;/a&gt; an Elm session in &lt;a href=&quot;http://yougottalovefrontend.com/#page-speakers&quot;&gt;YGLF conf&lt;/a&gt;. This was a great excuse to free up some hours to work on a new v0.17 SPA (Single Page Application). You won’t believe what happened next…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, you would: it was an awesome experience. :)&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, I’ve reached the point that the backend me is becoming jealous of the frontend me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui horizontal segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;demo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://elm-spa-example.gizra.com/&quot;&gt;View demo&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/elm-spa-example&quot;&gt;Get the source code&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/faithful-elm-amazing-router/image1.gif&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Fetch GitHub user's info on this fake login.
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal with building this demo app, was to give a small, yet realistic, look into how Elm
allows us to accomplish daily tasks such as HTTP requests, routing, access, and more.
It was important for me to structure it in the same way that we structure larger apps built for production, so that it could demonstrate more effectively how Elm can be used in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in Elm, and want to get a feeling of how it could be built for your apps, this might be a good starting point. I even wanted to add a single test to show how it could be done. But Elm being such a fun, predictable, opinionated, and fun (no mistake here, it deserves the double fun) to work with, I ended up adding more and more tests.&lt;br /&gt;
Isn’t that yet another great sign for Elm? I was adding unit tests for a &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; app, while we hardly added any unit tests for our Angular apps in production!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I held myself back from adding too many features, but I couldn’t resist polishing the existing ones, and adding &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of comments. With the compiler’s tough love and ever growing unit tests, changes were
so easy it almost felt like cheating (and note that I rarely write “easy” or “trivial” about development issues).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organic Groups and Message Stack in Drupal 8</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Hi geeks! Did the post title get you excited? Great, because Organic Groups (OG) and Message stack are
getting closer to being Drupal 8 ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give an overview about their state, the amazing
community effort around them, and also share some of my personal thoughts about contribution
to Drupal 8 in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organic-groups&quot;&gt;Organic Groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The heroes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/RoySegall&quot;&gt;@RoySegall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/pfrenssen&quot;&gt;@pfrenssen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/damiankloip&quot;&gt;@damiankloip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/chx&quot;&gt;@chx&lt;/a&gt; et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years Organic Groups has been one of the proven solutions for multi-sites functionality,
in the form of one code base, one database, and one dashboard to rule them all.
After so many years and seeing so many different implementations, such as Harvard’s OpenScholar, OpenAtrium, and many others, I’m even more confident OG is doing many things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of OG7’s concepts are being migrated to OG8, but obviously this is also a good time to fix some
old mistakes. One of the mistakes was treating users and content (i.e. non-user entities) alike. But, well, you know - they are not. Because when we came to re-think of it, membership really makes sense only for users. For example, if the membership state is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blocked&lt;/code&gt;, that should indeed be applied only to users. So we’ve changed it:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drupal 8: Migrate Nodes with Attachments Easily</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Drupal-8-manina is at its highest. Modules are being ported, blog posts are
being written, and new sites are being coded, so we in Gizra decided to join the
party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a simple site that will replace an existing static site. But we needed
to migrate node attachments, and we just couldn’t find an existing solution. Well,
it was time to reach out to the community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Any
example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Drupal&lt;/a&gt; 8
migration of files/ images out there? (including copy from source into public:// )
&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Amitai Burstein (@amitaibu) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amitaibu/status/718441947325677569&quot;&gt;April 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes after the tweet was published, we received a great hint from the fine folks at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://evolvingweb.ca/&quot;&gt;Evoloving Web&lt;/a&gt;. They were already migrating files into Drupal 8
from Drupal 7, and were kind enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/bringing-files-along-for-ride-to-d8&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we were still missing another piece of the puzzle, as we also wanted to migrate
files from an outside directory directly into Drupal. I gave my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jsacksick&quot;&gt;@jsacksick&lt;/a&gt; a poke (it’s easy, as he sits right in front of me), and he gave me the answer on a silver platter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Post has a happy end - we were able to migrate files and attach to a node!
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Gizra Way Webinar: Budget Goggles and the Time-Boxed Project</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Today we held our inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/thegizraway&quot;&gt;#TheGizraWay&lt;/a&gt; webinar. The web series is intended to showcase some of “The Gizra Way” principles - a set of best practices and methodologies, borrowed from the Open Source development world and applied to operations, workflow, and overall company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first in the series, we chose the topic of price estimations because it provides a real - and perhaps radical - example of how transparent communication from the beginning about a project’s needs alongside its budget can turn the process on it’s head. In the video below Amitai Burstein discusses how a budget-and time-driven discovery process gets a project off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next webinar - to take place in July 2016 - will be announced shortly. If you have any suggestions for topics or an idea that you would like to present in a future session &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:adam@gizra.com&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>12 Things I learned at my first DrupalCon</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;For years I have been hearing about DrupalCon from Brice and Amitai. Every six months they would send me a massive group photo and challenged me to locate them among the crazy mustaches, viking helmets, and identical t-shirts. Needless to say, I failed every time and the number of people in those pictures grew every year. I’m also happy to say that that last group photo - from a week ago - included me as well (Bonus points if you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/drupalassoc/26985071205/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;spot me&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Con was an overwhelmingly great experience and I learned a ton of new things. Here are the top 12:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-count-down-from-100-if-you-cant-fall-asleep-at-night&quot;&gt;1) Count down from 100 if you can’t fall asleep at night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DrupalCon’s sessions and keynotes are diverse and engaging. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/community-keynote-michael-schmid&quot;&gt;Community Keynote&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/schnitzel&quot;&gt;@schnitzel&lt;/a&gt; (Michael Schmid), was full of tips to keep your brain ready and aware, such as: Start your day doing things you dislike, drink plenty of water that will force you to take a lot of pee breaks, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDsE4xOQKbc/?taken-by=schnitzel&quot;&gt;play with kids&lt;/a&gt; to clear your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enormous amount of people and ideas exchanged in DrupalCon are so invigorating that you might find it hard to sleep at night. Try counting backwards slowly from hundred to zero. I have already put it to the test and it works - that tip alone was worth the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Orleans is a seafood and meat town. Crab, crawfish, sausages, bbq, and alligator - the Queen City is not known for its consumptions of vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast portions are huge and everything is golden-brown. But in New Orleans there is a special name for that little strip of green ground in the middle of a boulevard - “neutral ground” (thanks Trivia Night!).  Perhaps they can grow fresh vegetables there!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Job Posting Goes Viral</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;A little job posting has inspired me, as a woman and mother, to write down some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only recently joined this vibrant company that does amazing things in amazing ways. As part of my marketing role, I work hard to create content that accurately communicates the genuine nature of Gizra, its owners, and culture. My private worry (not so private now) is that marketing speak will diminish the true nature of the company - that Gizra will sound run of the mill when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just completed updating our marketing plan, specifically the section explaining “The Gizra Way” that in my opinion is the essence of this company, and right when my usual marketing concerns started to creep in,  Amitai, owner and CTO, does something so fabulous that perfectly demonstrates everything I have been working hard to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic Amitai, just being himself, put out a Facebook post from his personal page in the hopes to attract great talent in an unjustifiably overlooked pool of applicants - women and more specifically mothers.  In his own way he essentially says: “Hey - we are a family friendly company. If you are talented, we want you because you make us better.”  Very quickly this post became viral spreading in various women and mother Facebook groups generating discussion around women in tech.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migration Best Practices</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The wonderful Migrate module is used in every one of our projects, whether we have actual legacy
content, or “just” want to create dummy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/content/xss-attack/&quot;&gt;XSS content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you received from your client a scary looking SQL dump or Excel file with old website data. Where should you start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the best practices we apply in Gizra to ensure a smooth
migration project,
with the least possible amount of surprises or bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Docker and Travis-CI</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;If you have ever had to setup Travis-CI, I’m sure you know where the biggest pain
point is - debugging the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lost so many hours on intermediate commits, waiting for Travis to spin up a new box,
run the scripts only to see it fail on the last command. Not to mention how hard it is to debug a webapp
on a machine you don’t have direct access to, and there is no browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a new and better way - we can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-08-19-using-docker-on-travis-ci/&quot;&gt;Docker inside Travis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? In short, it means that setting up Travis, and debugging your test scripts has just become much easier. You can do all the setup, and the debugging from your own local computer!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Think Elm</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The 2nd Elm - TLV meetup was lots of fun. But it was in Hebrew, and the intersection
between Hebrew speakers and Elm devs is still very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve re-recorded my presentation in English. If you haven’t ever seen Elm, or
already develop in Elm and want to better understand “how to think Elm” this presentation
might give you a nudge in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elm i18n and Type Safety</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;We’ve reached the point we needed to translate one of our Elm apps to multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui horizontal segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;demo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gizra.github.io/elm-i18n-example/&quot;&gt;View demo&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/elm-i18n-example&quot;&gt;Get the source code&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elm-i18n/image1.gif&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked for existing solutions and stumbled upon the elm-i18n library. This
of course made us happy, to see that someone has already solved the problem for us. However, when we looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lukewestby/elm-i18n/tree/84d7da3a51d52a89d1e3371bfeb4f34eab05341c#example&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; something felt missing. Type safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gizra we deal most hours of our working days with PHP, so you can say we are
fearless developers. That is, we hope and believe our code is right, and
worst case we know we will catch our bugs on run time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Elm can make us better developers, and give us some safety!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Budget Goggles: A Common Language and Setting Expectations</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;By default IT projects will fail. They may still launch but not accomplish any one of the following requirements of a successful project: on time, within budget, with happy users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizra addresses this by defining the ambiguous with the simple but powerful principle that the &lt;strong&gt;budget dictates the project&lt;/strong&gt;. It all begins (and ends) at the price estimation. Our budget breakdown creates a common language for all stakeholders and sets expectations early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;strong&gt;discovery phase&lt;/strong&gt;, the project is broken down to &lt;strong&gt;timeboxed tasks&lt;/strong&gt; - each with a clear deadline and cost to produce the deliverable. We set the maximum time to complete a task at 12 hours because this number is easily grasped by all stakeholders. Every feature and bug has a price tag and we encourage our clients &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to try to buy them all (at least not at first).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of our budget breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Shoov Dashboard</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Hi there! Please meet our dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Our Shoov Dashboard
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoov.io&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt;. Did we mention Shoov before? I &lt;a href=&quot;/content/shoov-ci-tests-live-site&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/content/cross-browser-visual-regression-with-shoov&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/content/visual-regression-travis-shoov-ngrok&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. Basically every project we work on has full test coverage - like everyone’s, I know - but Shoov also provides us with a visual regression testing harness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoov constantly runs its tests in the background, 24x7. When everything passes the project icon is green. When a test fails, it’s red. The monitor sits in the main room, so everyone can see when there’s an issue and feel deeply ashamed of their fragile, error-prone, carbon based brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m kidding of course. We all make mistakes - we’re only human. But Shoov isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

Software is eating the world.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed.
&lt;footer&gt;William Gibson&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizra began its life as a product company, trying to solve a specific problem in the textile software space. As often happens, the product was taking a long time to build and the bills were accumulating, so Brice &amp;amp; Amitai took on a client project to pay rent, then another, and another, and seven years later found themselves leading a 20 person development house, doing projects for clients such as Harvard University, The UN and The European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, we felt it was time to take Gizra to the next level and put a real effort behind our products side. To do so, we formed a new company called Gizra Alpha and set it on a somewhat unusual path. The quotes above might give you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cross-Site Scripting attack detection</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;When we develop a website we should take care of many things like design, responsiveness, speed, QA - and of course, security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major security concerns in websites and web applications is Cross Site Scripting (XSS). You definitely don’t want somebody to run their own malicious code in your website.
And to avoid it - you would like to have some kind of “vaccine” from such “disease”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know about Drupal’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;check_plain()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter_xss()&lt;/code&gt; and similar functions that sanitize user generated text, but unless we are actively checking for XSS, how can we be sure we’ve added them on all the right places?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we found a nice solution for it that can be easily applied in your projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entities Diagram Graph</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;We are often challenged with the maintenance of existing projects that were developed by other agencies, or a new developer arrives and we need to quickly bring them on board. The complexity of legacy projects can be very high and the risk of breaking existing logic is something we want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way we like to look at a project before diving into the code is through its data structure. The different entities and their relations can tell us a lot about the business logic of the site and its internal logic. We assumed that if we could &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; generate a graph with all the bundles, entities, and their relations this complex task would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done this for a while now, I believe our assumption was right. Taking our open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/productivity#gizra-productivity&quot;&gt;Productivity project&lt;/a&gt; (Gizra’s internal ERP/Project management system) as an example, it’s much easier to look at the following graph and understand that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Work session&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Time tracking&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Payment&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Github Issue&lt;/code&gt; bundles are pointing at a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn points to an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; bundle. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Github Issue&lt;/code&gt; can also reference itself.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You might have heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://burningman.org/&quot;&gt;Burning Man&lt;/a&gt;. Basically it’s a lot of hippies settling down in the desert for a few days, setting up small camps with different themes that make up a big, temporary city.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elm-Hedley, App Overview</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In August 2015 I challenged myself (and later the rest of the Gizra devs) to create a typical web-app with all the bells and whistles in Elm. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizra.github.io/elm-hedley&quot;&gt;elm-hedley&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m super proud it is now featuring in Elm’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;front page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is going to give a high level overview and point out some parts that are worth noting. However, before diving into the technical section, it is important to emphasize the virtues of &lt;em&gt;simply doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would go back in the commits history you would see some nasty stuff that have been completely overhauled and polished. The only way of getting to that “improving” part is of course by starting! Only after that will one become smarter and recognize what needs improving, as well as be more experienced to know how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planet Elm</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;planetelm-langorg-is-live&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;planet.elm-lang.org&lt;/a&gt; is live!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, right? Planet Elm and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.elm-lang.org/feeds.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is up and running - just grab it, and the best Elm related posts would appear in your favorite RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the need for such a site the day I started with Elm. Getting the Gizra devs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/planet-elm&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; it was the next logical thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having this main site as a central place for aggregating all the interesting content about Elm is yet another step in getting Elm into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you maintain your own blog, go ahead, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/planet-elm/wiki/Planet-Elm-guidelines&quot;&gt;submit your RSS feeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mindful Custom Breakpoints</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of our projects at Gizra use &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for layout. We spend a lot of time and effort creating the perfect responsive layout and UX across all breakpoints. As Bootstrap comes by default with four breaking points, we naturally implemented them all, until we started asking ourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Is responsive really needed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, Of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Do we always need so many breakpoints?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: No. Or, to say it differently: Yes. But not necessarily immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I’m not against responsive design. I’m just saying each breakpoint has an impact on the project length and budget. It’s up to us to help the client decide how many breakpoints are right for them. As you know, Bootstrap can have &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindful-custom-breakpoint-bootstrap.gizra.com/&quot;&gt;custom breakpoints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Elm Challenge</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As part of our adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;/content/thinking-choosing-elm/&quot;&gt;Elm in production&lt;/a&gt;, Gizra devs are learning and practicing their Elm skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they are done going over the existing videos/tutorials, we let them get their hands dirty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/elm-hedley&quot;&gt;elm-hedley&lt;/a&gt; was created just for that - to simulate a simple yet typical web app with login, RESTful, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizra.github.io/elm-hedley&quot;&gt;existing app&lt;/a&gt;. As you see each event appears as a clickable link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to add a counter next to each event label that increments when clicked. When you refresh the page (F5) it shouldn’t remember the previous clicks and should start back at 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it should look like this (notice the bottom left list):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    
      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://gfycat.com/ifr/MellowUnpleasantBoar&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;653&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead, fork the repo and try for yourself. And don’t peek below, as it has the answer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Decoupled Drupal: When, Why, and How - The Video</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I believe it’s safe to say that Decoupled Drupal is here to stay. Back in DrupalCon Los Angeles my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/team/josh-koenig&quot;&gt;Josh Koenig&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and I teamed up to share our experience with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh asked me if I could do the presentation with him and I immediately agreed, as Josh is an awesome presenter and I knew it’s going to be fun. My answer, if I recall correctly, was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the session gets selected it will need to be partially weird. And you might need to grow a mustache for that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t grow a mustache. But it was fun and full of energy. And it has a lot of very pragmatic tips, such as &lt;strong&gt;Headless Drupal is a terrible idea!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough text - here is the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>Thinking (And Choosing) Elm</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/content/elmlang-headless-drupal/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I was giving a high level overview of why we were looking at Elm in Gizra. Since that post, we’ve almost completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizra.github.io/elm-hedley&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve changed our status from “Looking at Elm” to “Choosing Elm”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? In short - I believe it will save us money.&lt;br /&gt;
(Oh, and it’s fun)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>Elm Loves Headless Drupal</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Part of my job is to get my hands dirty with technologies I stumble upon. I’ve decided to have a go at React. Well, one thing led to the other and it seems I went down the client side rabbit hole. I’d like to share with you my path - watch out though, it’s a slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/elmlang/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&amp;amp;t=621&amp;amp;v=nYkdrAPrdcw&quot;&gt;Thinking Flux&lt;/a&gt; video which explains the problems Facebook faced in its front-end and the new application architecture they are now using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Flux concept was out, different libraries were written implementing it, but in my view it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://rackt.github.io/redux/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; is the winner in terms of simplicity, popularity, docs and community. I really recommend going over it - at least the intro and basics. You might be tempted to actually learn a bit of React (&lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;) to follow the examples more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw Redux was crediting &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt; for some of its inspiration, so I decided to give it a quick look. I was immediately blown away by Elm. The syntax is weird (unless you know Haskell), it has a crazy learning curve, but a lot of it makes so much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following recording is a presentation I first gave internally for Gizra devs, then as a BoF in DrupalCon Barcelona, and finally recorded to share it with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    
      &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_gTakI4Vfw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to get more people excited about Elm so the community and contributions grows. I feel it is now very much like Drupal about 10 years ago - a small community, far from being mainstream, but with a lot of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if we’ll draw from Drupal’s experience in building and cultivating a community we’ll be able to bring this awesome tool closer to the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sticky Floors and Happy Kids</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;There’s a saying “Good moms have sticky floors, messy kitchens, laundry piles, dirty ovens, and happy kids”. God knows I score an A+ and by that phrase alone I am THE perfect mother. But how do you leave those happy kids and get back to work?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/happy-kids/wonder-woman.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 3 kids (recent one is brand new - in fact I’m writing this post while being on maternity leave), which I absolutely adore and admire with every breath they take, a husband that I’m (still, after so many years together) crazy about and, lucky me, I love my job and co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be the fortunate one to hit the jackpot as a most people I know are not even satisfied with one thing, let alone three!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should know. I was “most people”. A nine to five office monkey, working tons of overtime and weekends, trying to get to the top. I was carefree at that time (for the singles in the crowd: this means no children) and my main concerns were questions such as what’s the best party to attend to on Thursday night? Which movie to go to on Friday night? What to eat, where? You get my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I met my husband; then came the kids; and then there was Gizra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gizra is known for our up-front, straightforward attitude, and as such I want to be very honest - on the verge of blunt - and share with you some thoughts.
I am a working mother. A wife. A person. Not by that specific order but that sounds just about right to me as I feel like the “person” part kicks in only after the kids are in beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asking myself some questions lately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to be at the office while I am on my maternity leave. Does that make me a bad mother?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I miss my kids and my husband and I want to be with them instead of being at the office, while I am at work. Does that make me a bad employee?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes I cannot stand the sound of my own name when one of my employees calls me, wants something from me. Does that make me a bad manager?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I find myself often screening my friends calls and avoiding meeting them (sometimes it involves telling a little white lie) because I just wanna stay home. Does that make me a bad friend?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes all I want is just be left alone for a while. No kids shouting M-O-M-M-Y, No employees telling me they need something from me. Does that make me a bad person?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to keep everyone happy? Your kids, your bosses, your employees, your friends, your husband, and last but not least - even yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
I just know I love my job; love my husband; love my kids (definitely not in that specific order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I don’t have all the answers, far from it, but I’d like to share some tips on how you can make family and work combine (just a little bit) better together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Working nine to five?&lt;/code&gt; - Not necessarily! Try to be flexible in terms of working hours. You are killing two birds with one stone: arriving early means you get to leave early - just in time to get your kids out of daycare.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Safety net&lt;/code&gt; - There’s nothing like family support, if you’re fortunate enough to have one who is able to help you. Play nice with your mother in law, your brother, your distant cousin etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Don't be a stranger&lt;/code&gt; - There’s a saying “Better a nearby neighbor than a far away brother”. Get to know your neighbors just a little bit better, you might find it useful one day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Don't be sociopaths&lt;/code&gt; - Everybody knows that the worst thing in the world is to be in a kindergarten’s WhatsApp group! I’d be the first to admit it - once I’ve been added to one, I curse like hell and immediately silence it for a year! Who wants to get messages announcing the appearance of lice or which kid lost his coat or a toy. However, it may save your ass if you’re stuck in traffic or in an important meeting and you might need another mom or dad to take your kids out of the kindergarten/school.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Playdates - Try to convince your kids to go to a playdate, preferably at another mom’s house! That way you have some peace and quiet to finish some tasks you were suppose to finish long time ago or to finish an important presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well known DrupalCon fact is that the action mostly takes place in the hallways and social gatherings. The logic is that the sessions are recorded, and the rest isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On DrupalCon L.A. I was spending most of my time in the hallways stalking people to show them the newly born &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoov.io/&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt; and ask for their feedback. One of those people was my good friend Mike Anello, which later expressed his feelings about Shoov in this fun DrupalEasy &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupaleasy.com/podcast/2015/05/drupaleasy-podcast-153-drupalcon-los-angeles-day-2-recap&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months later, with the next DrupalCon already around the corner and Shoov maturing every day, I’ve contacted him to get his feedback on what we have so far, and I got this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think one that could help me and other developers is almost something like a glossary. I’ve heard of many of the technologies in your visual monitoring “stack”, but not entirely clear on what the purpose of each one is (Yeoman, WebdriverCSS, mocha, etc… - Behat I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start from the end, because those three words made an impact on me - “Behat I know”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reader of this post you are probably familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/&quot;&gt;Behat&lt;/a&gt; or at least know what functional testing frameworks are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that time in the past you didn’t?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you remember that time in the past where functional testing was just a &lt;em&gt;nice to have&lt;/em&gt; for you and not the &lt;em&gt;life saver&lt;/em&gt; it is now days?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visually Monitoring Drupal.org</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In recent months I’ve been demoing visual monitoring to many developers. The reaction was always positive, but I’ve realized that not enough people have taken the step from recognizing the need to actually implementing it on their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been following my recent blog posts or tweets you’ve probably noticed we are trying to bring visual monitoring along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoov.io&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt; to the masses. To do so we’re trying to reduce the complexity and codify our “lessons learned”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    
      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://gfycat.com/ifr/FrailVioletEmperorpenguin&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Drupal.org visually monitored by Shoov
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeoman generators is one way to achieve this. With the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-shoov&quot;&gt;yo shoov&lt;/a&gt; - a single command makes sure all the files needed for visual monitoring are immediately scaffolded in your repository. In fact, it also sets up Behat tests along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/drupal.org-shoov/blob/master/.shoov.yml&quot;&gt;.shoov.yml&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Shoov to run your visual monitoring tests periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since visual monitoring might be new for a lot of people, the generator not only scaffolds the files but also attempts to check if your system is properly installed, and tells you how to fix it if not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why PhantomJS When You Can Chrome</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Following our &lt;a href=&quot;/content/live-monitor-shoov-irony/&quot;&gt;unfortunate bug&lt;/a&gt; in Shoov which caused login to stop working, we decided to write a Behat test that will continuously check the live site and make sure login with GitHub is working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the Behat test was pretty easy, however it had a major problem - it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-gherkin highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;@javascript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Login to shoov
  &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Given &lt;/span&gt;I am an anonymous user
   &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;When &lt;/span&gt;I visit the homepage
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;And &lt;/span&gt;I login with my GitHub account
   &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Then &lt;/span&gt;I should wait for the text &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;My Account&quot;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;appear&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Behat sees the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@javascript&lt;/code&gt; tag in the begining of the scenario, it launches it (with the help of Mink extension) in PhantomJS, Firefox or Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
PhantomJS is usually the easiest to configure and hook into the CI workflow later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the test we wrote just failed on all versions of PhantomJS we tried. Which made us switch to Firefox instead. Travis CI is kind enough to have a headless Firefox installed in their machine which we could use. Unfortunately, Firefox didn’t like our test either, but for another reason - it couldn’t parse the xpath we use to find our text elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after spending some time trying to figure out a workaround, I suddenly stared at the browser I was using to find the answer - Chrome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    
      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://gfycat.com/ifr/ThirstyOfficialDikkops&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    

    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Live Monitoring With Shoov And Some Sweet Irony</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Irony presents itself in many forms. Not being able to login to a site that is responsible for testing that the login is working properly on other live sites, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I’d like to say I was able to enjoy the irony, the six hours I spent tracking the bug were slightly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoov.io/&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt; is built for is assisting us with a quick configuration of live site monitoring using your preferred functional testing tool (e.g. Behat or CasperJS).&lt;br /&gt;
As awesome as services like Pingdom are, they still provide very little insight to what’s actually going on in the site. In fact, according to Pingdom, Shoov was up and running, even though no user could have logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Shoov login now working. When it wasn't, the fish were sad
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-mortem&quot;&gt;Post Mortem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point of time I think very few people care about the “post mortem” of this incident since Shoov is still a work in progress, however some interesting lessons were learned, and some contributions were made.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forking Todo Restful with Backbone.Marionette</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this guest post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukeherrington&quot;&gt;Luke Herrington&lt;/a&gt; shares his experience with integrating an existing Drupal backend with a Backbone.Marionette Todo app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, you probably already know about all of the great work that Gizra has done in the Drupal/REST space. If you haven’t, I highly recommend you check out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; repo. Also see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RESTful-Drupal&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the projects that Amitai has contributed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/todo_restful&quot;&gt;Todo Restful&lt;/a&gt;. It shows an Angular implementation of the canonical &lt;a href=&quot;http://todomvc.com/&quot;&gt;TodoMVC&lt;/a&gt; Javascript app connecting to a headless Drupal backend. It’s a great demonstration of how easy exposing Drupal content with the RESTful module is. It also shows that when a RESTful API adheres to best practices, connecting it with clients that follow the same best practices is like a nice handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the Todo Restful project and it got me thinking, “If Amitai did this right (hint: he did), then I should be able to get this working with Backbone pretty easily”. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual regression tests on every commit</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As we dive deeper into visual regression testing in our development workflow we realize a sad truth: on average, we break our own CSS every week and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t feel bad for us, as in fact I’d argue that it’s pretty common across all web projects - they just don’t know it.  It seems we all need a system that will tell us when we break our CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know of a single (good) system that does this, we were able to connect together a few (good) systems to get just that, with the help of:
Travis-CI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss&quot;&gt;webdriverCSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoov.io/&quot;&gt;Shoov.io&lt;/a&gt;, BrowserStack/Sauce Labs, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;. Oh my!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be alarmed by the long list. Each one of these does one thing very well, and combining them together was proven to be not too complicated, nor too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can jump right into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/Gizra/blob/master/.travis.yml&quot;&gt;.travis&lt;/a&gt; file of the Gizra repo to see its configuration, or check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/Gizra/blob/master/ui-tests/test/tests.js#L36-L37&quot;&gt;webdriverCSS&lt;/a&gt; test. Here’s the high level overview of what we’re doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gizra.com&lt;/a&gt; is built on Jekyll but visual regression could be executed on every site, regardless of the underlying technology. Travis is there to help us build a local installation. Travis also allows adding encrypted keys, so even though the repo is public, we were able to add our Shoov.io and ngrok access tokens in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to use services such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.browserstack.com/&quot;&gt;BrowserStack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://saucelabs.com/&quot;&gt;Sauce-Labs&lt;/a&gt; to test our local installation on different browsers (e.g. latest chrome and IE11). For that we need to have an external URL accessible by the outside world, which is where ngrok comes in: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok http -log=stdout -subdomain=$TRAVIS_COMMIT 9000&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file exposes our Jekyll site inside the Travis box to a unique temporary URL based on the Git commit (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://someCommitHash.ngrok.io&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebdriverCSS tests are responsible for capturing the screenshots, and comparing them against the baseline images. If a regression is found, it will be automatically pushed to Shoov, and a link to the regression would be provided in the Travis log. This means that if a test was broken, we can immediately see where’s the regression and figure out if it is indeed a bug - or, if not, replace the baseline image with the “regression” image.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Monitoring your live site is a pretty good idea - that’s generally agreed. Same goes for visual regression testing. Doing it, however, is hard. Enough so that very few companies actually do visual regression testing/monitoring, so don’t feel bad if you haven’t either until now. But after reading this post you should seriously consider doing it. Or at least give it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shoov/test-example&quot;&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s an overview of how we could monitor Twitter, if someone would actually ask us to (as always you can jump right into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amitaibu/ci-tests-twitter&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>AngularJs Ui-Router</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;One of the things I love to do is watch movies at home with my soon-to-be-wife (with emphasis on &lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt; as I’m getting married tomorrow!). We have seen a lot of them over the years so it’s not always easy to find a new movie or to remember a good movie that’s worth watching again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with my love to JavaScript I’ve decided to create an AngularJS app with &lt;a href=&quot;http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/sample/&quot;&gt;ui-router&lt;/a&gt; library.  The demo app fetches Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/movies/&quot;&gt;iTunes top 60&lt;/a&gt; movies and presents the info and trailer for each, and even has a cool archive feature that lets you create your own private collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui horizontal segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;demo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yaronmiro.github.io/AngularJS-UI-Router-Demo&quot;&gt;View demo&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui center aligned secondary grey segment&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/YaronMiro/AngularJS-UI-Router-Demo&quot;&gt;Get the source code&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Cross Browser Visual Regression Tests With Shoov</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Maintaining visual regression tests can be hard, but the more tests we write for our projects, the more we see the tremendous power it provides in terms of QA and monitoring our sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One daunting task each developer hates (and often avoids) is validating their markup on multiple browsers. All of Gizra’s developers use either Mac or Ubuntu on their machines, so the line to the “IE computer” on the far end of the office is getting long. Way too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And honestly - after our poor developers validated their work once, if we’d ask them to do it again. And again. And again… we’d probably be left without any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers moral shouldn’t be underestimated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/shoov-ui-regression/&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt; means “Again” in Hebrew for this very reason.Go ahead and jump to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shoov/test-example&quot;&gt;example repo&lt;/a&gt; which now has cross browser tests. Writing your tests once - but testing on multiple platforms and browsers is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>simpleTest with Behat for Drupal 8</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/&quot;&gt;Behat&lt;/a&gt; was at DrupalCon Munich 2012. Since then use of Behat has grown exponentially and the tools it can be integrate with grew as well. With Behat we can test the markup of a page - pretty neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s time to take Behat integration with Drupal a little further. I’ve decided to try and integrate it with Drupal’s simpleTest, as this would open the door for writing simpleTests that are more readable and more “behavior driven” by nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Gherkin&quot;&gt;Scenario: Testing the login form.
  Given I visit 'user'
    And I fill in 'Username' with '@user-name'
    And I fill in 'Password' with '@user-pass'
   When I press 'Log in'
   Then I should see '@user-name'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly enough, the above Gherkin code which is being executed by PHPunit can test your Drupal installation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      Behat code executed from within Drupal's simpleTest
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality is provided by an experimental &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RoySegall/behat&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with an example test.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shoov - CI tests on the live site</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/shoov-ui-regression/&quot;&gt;Shoov&lt;/a&gt; keeps evolving, and now has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shoov/test-example&quot;&gt;example repo&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates how we’re trying to make UI regression simpler, we took some time to implement the second feature we were missing - automatic testing on the &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw a very strange situation everywhere we looked: Dev teams were writing amazing test coverage. They were going the extra mile to setup a Travis box with environment as close as possible to the live site. They tested every single feature, and added a regression test for every bug. Heck, every commit triggered a test suite that run for an hour before being carefully reviewed and merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the site goes live - and at best they might add &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pingdom.com/&quot;&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt; monitoring to check it’s working. Pingdom at its simplest form sends an http request every minute to your site. If the answer is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;200&lt;/code&gt; - it means that all is good in the world. Which is of course wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to change this, and bring functional testing to the live site. One that is easy to setup and that integrates with your existing testing and GitHub flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/shoov-ci-build/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      The Drupal backend holds the CI build data, including the full log, and status
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pingdom is wonderful and is alerting us on time whenever a site goes down, its “page is fine, move along” approach doesn’t cut it for us. Here are some examples why testing on the production server is a good idea:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shoov - a new UI regression tool</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Testing UI regression is one of these things that make total sense but is rarely put into practice, for a simple reason - it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      UI regression checking in action
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the theory about it, it seems pretty simple. Take a screenshot of a certain page in your site which will be your “baseline” image, and from now on, whenever the code changes re-run an automated test that will compare a current screenshot with the baseline image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this data looks familiar to you, it might be because it’s the same data you see via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/content/yo-hedley/&quot;&gt;Hedley’s&lt;/a&gt; Angular client.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Logs, The Easy Way</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Your team invested countless hours in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your QA people can barely keep their eyes open - they have worked so hard. Your lead developer who’s responsible for the deployment is almost dehydrated from so much pressure and sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s all worth it. Your app is live. Now everybody goes to sleep, and your pampered app, is all alone, serving your data to the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You forgot one thing - to give it a phone to call home, and tell you something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(Automatic) QA</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Here is a known fact - it’s really easy to break the sites you are building. One wrong line of code, and a page is returning a 503 error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a known secret - (almost) nobody is doing QA. Since I’m not into arguing about this, I’m willing to soften it a bit to “most companies, don’t do proper QA”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons are pretty clear - not enough time and not enough budget. This post isn’t going to be about the importance of QA - that point is clear to everybody, but rather give &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; tips and tools that will allow you to start improving the quality of your projects, and actually even save you some time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hedley Generator - PhantomCSS and UI regression</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;What’s fun about having a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;/content/yo-hedley/&quot;&gt;Hedley&lt;/a&gt; is that every new best practice we acquire can be easily added to our ever evolving, versioned, and codified knowledge base - and it’s there for the community to use and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as if it didn’t have enough of best practices bundled in it already, we’ve taken another step to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS&quot;&gt;PhantomCSS&lt;/a&gt; a “CSS regression testing” tool in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Bingo! I think we’re on to something here. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley&quot;&gt;yo hedley&lt;/a&gt; - and it’s one command that brings a true headless Drupal to &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last DrupalCon BoF presentation “&lt;a href=&quot;content/gizra-we-have-got-your-headless-covered/&quot;&gt;Gizra - we’ve got your headless covered&lt;/a&gt;” I’ve taken the time to explain why “headless” was in fact mostly a buzzword. While I encourage you to have a look at the presentation, I’m actually more excited about telling you why I feel this is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead an check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hedley-demo.gizra.com/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Behat vs. Casper (In Drupal Context)</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In my previous blog post &lt;a href=&quot;/content/behat-the-right-way&quot;&gt;Behat - The Right Way&lt;/a&gt; I made a statement that I think Behat was a better choice for writing tests even for the frontend. Some good arguments were raised in favor of CasperJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amitaibu&quot;&gt;@amitaibu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/juampy72&quot;&gt;@juampy72&lt;/a&gt; it boils down to this: I&amp;#39;m a frontend dev. Writing PHP is something I avoid whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chris Ruppel (@rupl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rupl/status/535025236702683136&quot;&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe my comparison was wrong in the sense it was lacking the key point to Behat’s stength for us. It’s not really about “Behat vs. Casper”. The proper comparison should have been “Behat vs. Casper - &lt;em&gt;With a Drupal backend&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the key difference: With Behat you can interact with Drupal’s API even when testing using PhantomJS. That is a lot of testing power!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Todo app with RESTful backend</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The Drupal community can now proudly claim its own implementation of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizra.github.io/todo_restful/#/&quot;&gt;Todo app&lt;/a&gt; with a RESTful backend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://todomvc.com/&quot;&gt;TodoMVC&lt;/a&gt; is a site that helps you select the right JS MVC library. But more then that, it allows you to learn by comparing those libraries, as they all implement the same thing - a simple Todo app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to fork the &lt;a href=&quot;http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/&quot;&gt;Angular example&lt;/a&gt;, and build it on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/restful&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the Angular code, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Behat - The Right Way</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://behat.org&quot;&gt;Behat&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful tool for automatic testing. It allows you to write your user stories and scenarios in proper English, which is then parsed by Behat and transformed to a set of clicks or other operations that mimic a real user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have automated tests on your project, I would argue that you’re doing it wrong (I explain why on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/drupal-development-gizra-way&quot;&gt;The Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt; presentation). Even having a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; test is much better than none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, it’s super easy to abuse Behat. We are developers and we think sort of like machines (not really, but you get my point). If you would like to test login to your site you could easily do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-cucumber highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Given &lt;/span&gt;I visit &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/user/login&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# fill the username and password input fields, and click submit&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;When &lt;/span&gt;I fill &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;username&quot;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;And &lt;/span&gt;I fill &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;password&quot;&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;And &lt;/span&gt;I press &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Login&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Then &lt;/span&gt;I should get a &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;200&quot;&lt;/span&gt; HTTP response
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your test will return green, but it could be improved:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RESTful Discovery - Who knows about your API?</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As extremely pedantic developers we take documenting our APIs very seriously. It’s not rare to see a good patch rejected in code review just because the PHPdocs weren’t clear enough, or a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@param&lt;/code&gt; wasn’t declared properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I often explain to junior devs that the most important part of a function is its signature, and the PHPdocs. The body of the function is just “implementation details”. How it communicates its meaning to the person reading it is the vital part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where does this whole pedantic mindset got when we open up our web-services?&lt;br /&gt;
I would argue that at least 95% of the developers who expose their web-service simply enable RESTws without any modifications. And here’s what a developer implementing your web-service will see when visiting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/node.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gizra - We've Got Your Headless Covered</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-name-of-the-angular-component-for-login&quot;&gt;What’s the name of the Angular component for login?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties in creating a semi or fully decoupled site isn’t in the RESTful part. Spitting out JSON is now covered by several modules, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/restful&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; which aims for a “best practices” solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the real problems, though, is how to prevent us, the community, from re-inventing the wheel over and over again. Basically, how do we package our frontend code similarly to how we package our generic backend code - AKA “modules”. I discussed these problems, and offered some solutions in my “BoF” persentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>Headless Drupal - Form API, Drupal 9</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-moment&quot;&gt;Defining moment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago my DrupalCon Austin session was rejected. I was a bit upset, since presenting plays a big part in my trip to the states, and also surprised, as I mistakenly assumed my presentation repertoire would almost guarantee my session would be accepted. But the committee decided differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been an important moment for me. Two days later I told myself I don’t care. I mean, I cared about the &lt;em&gt;presentation&lt;/em&gt;, I just stopped caring that it was not selected, since I decided I was going to do it anyway. As an “unplugged” BoF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/drupal-development-gizra-way&quot;&gt;The Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt;. I think this is probably the best presentation I’ve given so far, and quite ironically my &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; session is second only to Dries’s keynote in YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see - I had a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzm8kTIj_0M&quot;&gt;there is no spoon&lt;/a&gt;” moment. The second I realized it can be done differently, I was on my own track, perhaps even setting the path for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;form-api-drupal-9&quot;&gt;Form API, Drupal 9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I use Drupal because Form API is so great &amp;lt;div class=&quot;small&quot;&amp;gt;No one, ever&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Headless Drupal - Inline edit</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/content/restful-angular-forms/&quot;&gt;last example&lt;/a&gt; we showed how to create node using an angular form served from Drupal itself. This time we are taking one big step further and create the node from a completely decoupled &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/angular-drupal-forms-example&quot;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
And if that’s not enough for the readers excited by the idea of a decoupled Drupal, we’ve also added inline editing to the example!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizra.github.io/angular-drupal-forms-example/#/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Backend-free apps with Grunt, jekyll and D3.js</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;When we started working on a mobile web site for &lt;a href=&quot;/content/casa-del-lector/&quot;&gt;Casa del Lector&lt;/a&gt;’s exhibition, we decided early on it would be a backend-free app, mainly for reasons of stability and performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/backendless-apps/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      App is faster than 96% of other websites
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data was entered by the client on a 3rd party desktop tool which exported it to XML. We used a bunch of open source tools to massage it a bit and prepare it for the App. Since the project is open sourced you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/CDL&quot;&gt;actual code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      The App in action
    &lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Headless Drupal, One form at a time</title>
        <description>
          &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form API is great, but Form API is hard when you try to do fancier stuff - like wizards and other things that clients often want.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angular forms are great, but Angular forms are hard too - you need to write your own custom endpoints and server side validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/restful&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; integrates with Entity Validator, I would change the equation and simply say something rarely heard in the Drupal community: Forms are Fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/restful-angular-forms/angular-form.gif&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned caption segment&quot;&gt;
      This form is not Form API, it's angular!
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/restful/blob/7.x-1.x/modules/restful_angular_example/README.md#test-on-simplytestme-recommended&quot;&gt;try it&lt;/a&gt; yourself on simplyTest.me&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No more CSS in your Drupal Theme!</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;treat-your-custom-css-as-contrib&quot;&gt;Treat your custom CSS as contrib&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting your Drupal to be pixel perfect is hard. In fact, it’s probably four times faster to write the logic
of a page, in comparison to the time it takes to get it’s markup right. Not to talk about making it responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen my presentation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/hJhZb8&quot;&gt;The Gizra Way&lt;/a&gt; you noticed we take pixel perfect very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that helps us getting the markup fast, correct and in a way that would allow us to communicate with the client is Jekyll - the static site generator. Here’s the idea in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using Jekyll we can concentrate on a clean markup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using Grunt we compile the SASS, and are able to push the the HTML into Github pages - where the client can easily see and interact with the final markup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The CSS produced by Jekyll is treated by our Drupal application as contrib. This means we have zero custom CSS in our theme. Seriously, &lt;strong&gt;absolutely no custom CSS in your Drupal theme!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any change to the CSS can be done only in a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; place, which is Jekyll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Creating a Custom Breakpoint in Bootstrap-Sass</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap is our go to base theme, but what happens when the grid the client asks for has different width, or more break points?
Using Bootstrap-Sass creating a custom grid is possible in a manner that can be copied and adjusted from one project to another. As example for this post, and for your future reference you may follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizra.github.io/custom-breakpoint-example/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/custom-breakpoint-example&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that changes Bootstrap to work with five breakpoints (tip: use &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/&quot;&gt;Resizer&lt;/a&gt; for easy viewport resize).&lt;br /&gt;
Note that example is using Jekyll for simplicity, however the same technique can be used on Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Emmet!</title>
        <description>
          &lt;h2 id=&quot;instant-html-and-css&quot;&gt;Instant HTML and CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmet is a great tool that can enhance your productivity and save you a lot of time when coding or prototyping.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of you may know it as “Zen coding” and for quite some time (Since 2012) it’s known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://emmet.io/&quot;&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmet is a plugin for a text editor which greatly improves html and css workflow.&lt;br /&gt;
The idea behind it is to instantly expand a simple abbreviation (shortened form of a word or phrase) into complex code snippet.&lt;br /&gt;
Emmet uses these abbreviations to parse them in runtime and transform them into structured code block: HTML, CSS, XML or any other structured markup.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Submitting an app to the iTunes App Store is, to put it mildly, not as simple as one might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afters struggling with it a few times, we thought it might be useful to create a step-by-step guide - hopefully you might find it useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The @amitaibu show (unplugged)</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Did you actually think I’m going to be in a DrupalCon without giving a presentation?
Oh, the fact that my session was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; selected made you think that. I see. I can understand how that could have caused the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thing is that I have a presentation titled “The Gizra Way” that I’ve been giving for the past year all over Israel, and recently in DrupalCamp Spain. Reactions were pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My prediction is that most watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DrupalcampEs&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#DrupalcampEs&lt;/a&gt; video will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amitaibu&quot;&gt;@amitaibu&lt;/a&gt; session as soon as it is available. Really inspiring!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; penyaskito (@penyaskito) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/penyaskito/statuses/467674213906931712&quot;&gt;May 17, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still looking for a place to do it. Maybe in a BoF room. Or in the staircase. Or a bar near the hotel.
And you know what? I’m really excited about this idea. It feels like I’m preparing for the unplugged version of my show. Anyway, we’ll &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gizra_drupal&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; the time and location once we find the place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to have lunch without speaking Drupal</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Oh no, It’s lunch time!&lt;br /&gt;
I wonder if I’ll have anything to contribute to the conversation today. Will lunch today - like yesterday or the day before that - revolve around pull requests, Organic groups, migrate, scrum, code reviews, modules. Boring.&lt;br /&gt;
If you share the same feeling reading the above lines, this blog post if for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/lunch/photo1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;

      Geeks having a spontaneous reaction to a new version of a Drupal module. I love those guys!
    &lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong - I love my job and I love my co-workers as well. It’s just that every time they talk about these things it makes me wanna stand up on our designer kitchen chair and shout:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My name is Orit and I am not a Drupal geek!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never developed any module in my life, didn’t contribute anything to OG nor have I never requested Brice or Amitai to give me a scrutinizing code review. So here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RESTful module</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/restful#restful-best-practices-for-drupal&quot;&gt;RESTful module&lt;/a&gt; is a new approach to providing a REST server in Drupal. Its concepts and philosophy appears in the module’s README so I won’t repeat it, but I’d like to go over some of the key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Handler v1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;restful_get_restful_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'articles'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// GET method.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Output:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'label'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'example title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'self'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://example.com/node/1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Handler v1.1 extends v1.0, and removes the &quot;self&quot; property from the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// exposed properties.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;restful_get_restful_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'articles'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Output:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'label'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'example title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year almost every site we have is either completely decoupled from the server side where AngularJs serves the webapp, or AngularJS plays a smaller part, and we just embed web components inside a Drupal page to provide a slick UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now our go to module was RestWs by the wonderful Klausi, which wraps around Entity API module’s metadata wrapper. Basically, it hands over to the metadata wrapper the responsibility for the access and for the actual value it spits out.
It works fine, however the JSON it exposes has too much information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Casa del Lector</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Last week saw the launch of a pretty unique &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizra.github.io/CDL/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; for us. It’s not every day a product we’ve worked on gets a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2014/03/05/actualidad/1394047004_090821.html&quot;&gt;write up on El Pais&lt;/a&gt;, or has this kind of launch event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/casa-del-lector/IMG_8388-2.JPG&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target audience is a bit unusual as well. While it can be accessed like any other site, it’s targeted to be used inside a specific exhibition in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://casalector.fundaciongsr.com/&quot;&gt;Casa del Lector&lt;/a&gt; museum in Madrid, on tablets handed out to the museum visitors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/casa-del-lector/IMG_8259%20-%202.JPG&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took great care to stay within the touch UI conventions. When entering the site, the user is presented with a network of connections between items. As she zooms, details are revealed - subitems, their connections and finally their titles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>Zariz Loves Entity Reference</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Zariz is now integrated with entity reference and is “branch” aware. This means
that the reference will change on the fly. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OpenScholar and the new Biblio</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;OpenScholar is the de facto go to solution for academic sites. Over the past year we saw it being adopted in many Harvard departments and higher ed institutions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com//assets/images/posts/os-biblio/6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud that our work is not just based on open source, but also contributes to it - big time. Case in point, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/biblio&quot;&gt;Biblio&lt;/a&gt; module which is responsible for bibliographies and citations since back in Drupal 4.6, and has provided a great solution. It was becoming clear the 4.6 architecture is showing its age, and could use an overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zariz on TV</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I had a fun conversation with Jam this morning, regarding &lt;a href=&quot;/content/zariz-means-agile/&quot;&gt;Zariz&lt;/a&gt; - the set of Drupal modules we’re developing that (a) &lt;a href=&quot;/content/zariz-in-pics/&quot;&gt;brings version control into the content space&lt;/a&gt; and (b) &lt;a href=&quot;/content/drupal-x5-faster/&quot;&gt;brings Drupal into the static site space&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re into that kind of stuff, you might enjoy it too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

        <title>Drupal, only x5 faster</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live&lt;/code&gt; branch on the Drupal site&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the static site created out of the live site. It looks the same, but loads x5 faster.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zariz in Pics</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/zariz&quot;&gt;Zariz &lt;/a&gt; isn’t just about static sites. In fact the Zariz module itself isn’t aware of any static generation. It’s about modeling the content creation around Git, which is a new approach to content staging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 images that will make the whole idea clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;live&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We branch out of it&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zariz Means Agile</title>

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/zariz&quot;&gt;Zariz&lt;/a&gt; is a new project we’re working on. The word means “quick”, or “agile” in Hebrew. We’ve began working on it when we hit some bumps working on Dekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dekyll-frustrations&quot;&gt;Dekyll Frustrations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dekyll was Jekyll based. We love Jekyll - it powers our own site, and in fact I’m writing this blog post with the excellent Prose.io. But for Dekyll we wanted to stay close to Drupal, keeping the various abilities it developed over the years like fine grained access control, workflows etc and allowing users to stay within an environment they already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on Jekyll added another component to the system. A very good one, but still with its own requirements and needs. We wanted to simplify, and minimize the number of moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-beginning&quot;&gt;A New Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we were back at the drawing board. Around that time I saw Clay Shirky’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html&quot;&gt;Ted talk&lt;/a&gt;. When he gave that funny yet precise explanation about why lawyers don’t use Git, I realized something.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How We Achieve Faster Development and Happier Clients by Opening Our GitHub Issues</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As we &lt;a href=&quot;/content/the-gizra-way/&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; before, in Gizra each project’s GitHub repository - code, issues etc - is completely open &amp;amp; transparent to the client from the day we start working together. We’ve discovered this provides us with some unexpected benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tipa.li – a Tool for Easily Finding Polio Vaccination Clinics</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;No one is sure what caused the Polio virus, eradicated from Israel since the 1990s, to reappear. The virus was detected in sewage samples in the south of the country in early summer and began spreading northwards, prompting Ministry of Health to start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/02/217194998/to-keep-polio-at-bay-israel-revaccinates-a-million-kids&quot;&gt;massive vaccination drive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents of children under the age of 9 were asked to bring them to the nearest Tipat Halav clinic for vaccination. Country-run Tipat Halav (in Hebrew, “drop of milk”) childcare clinics are a household name in Israel. Spread throughout the country, they helped it reach some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN/compare?country=il#country=au:xd:xr:xs:il:gb:us&quot;&gt;world’s lowest infant mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health decided to create a mobile application to help parents find the nearest clinic. It commissioned one of the country’s largest development shops to create it. They decided to create a native app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matrix.tipathalav&quot;&gt;This is the Android version&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/assets/images/posts/tipa/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume the iOS version is still undergoing the App Store approval process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the app during lunch at Gizra. We’re no doctors, but we thought we could do something about the software. Going with a native app didn’t seem ideal for a single-use application which needs to be deployed on as many platforms ASAP. As for the UI, I’ll leave the image above as an exercise to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source - Real World</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this guest post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itamarburstein.com/&quot;&gt;Itamar Burstein&lt;/a&gt; shares his thoughts about “Open source” - the culture that Drupal belongs to - as seen through the eyes of an Industrial designer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amitai, my brother asked me to write a little something about, and I quote, “Open source or Drupal or whatever” - to give some examples and to show some pictures. He was very particular about the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a good moment to point out that I’m a designer, industrial designer, I mostly work with the furniture industry making very specific objects which are decided by the manufacturer, a bunch of business guys and, well, myself.  You can imagine that open source doesn’t have much to do with what I am doing, but he asked, and I don’t like to disappoint my baby brother.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dekyll's new Github Pages flavor</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/dekyll-drupal-on-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Dekyll&lt;/a&gt; (Drupal on Jekyll) comes now in two flavors. The first one is “normal”, which is more advanced and allows you to build more complex websites, the second is called “Github Pages” and it lets you quickly serve a new site using Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working hard in Gizra to make this process as smooth as possible, with the goal of letting non-developers the ability to serve their content using Jekyll, on Github Pages - without them having to bother with knowing what Jekyll, Git or Github Pages are. A worthy goal indeed, but not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dekyll - Drupal on Jekyll</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Drupal is no doubt one of the best CMS out there; Jekyll is no doubt one of the best static site generators out there. See where I’m going? And it’s no longer just a concept, it is a complete installation profile called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Gizra/dekyll&quot;&gt;Dekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-drupalcon-portland-bof&quot;&gt;The DrupalCon Portland BoF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had this idea, of combining Drupal and Jekyll. It was a result of building &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;gizra.com&lt;/a&gt; with Jekyll. When I came to Portland I already knew that apart of the usual business schmoozing, and presenting OG and the Message stack, I wanted to get other people’s opinion on our idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to see more than 20 people in the BoF (Birds of Feather) session. I had a vision of what I wanted but I still didn’t have the elevator pitch for it. The discussion we had helped sharpen the way I can explain that vision. To quote Steve Persch (@stevector)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I heard your idea I thought it’s crazy. After the BoF I still thought it’s crazy… but!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into Dekyll, let’s understand what are the problems that it tries to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amitai's DrupalCon Portland Presentation</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Amitai returned from DrupalCon Portland reporting it was raining all the time, the flights were very long (apparently the “Gizra Platinum Executive Traveller” card we gave him in the office failed to deliver the expected First Class upgrade) and he still doesn’t really get Portlandia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, he had an awesome conference and a great presentation on Organic Groups and Message modules, sprinkled with anecdotes from the open source module developer’s life. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/drupalcon-portland-video-amitai-burstein-organic-groups-message&quot;&gt;Pantheon’s&lt;/a&gt; video crew, you can now verify the latter claim yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Gizra Way - How We Roll (and Rollback)</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;My involvement with Gizra is a bit unusual. Before settling into my fake Aeron in Gizra’s plush Tel Aviv facilities I was actually a client for two years, contracting Brice &amp;amp; Amitai to write code for a New York startup I was working for. Together, we managed to build a continuous deployment setup where we pushed new code to production every day while working 7 timezones apart, while, surprisingly, keeping our sanity mostly intact.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harvard's OpenScholar</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;When people ask you about big projects done with Drupal, what’s the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; item on your list? I know the first one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/&quot;&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt; - that’s not Drupal’s foot in the door, it’s the foot that broke the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share with you the second item on our list. Harvard. Seriously. If it’s the first time you hear that Harvard is using Drupal, or that they have an amazing distribution they work on called &lt;a href=&quot;http://openscholar.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Harvard OpenScholar&lt;/a&gt;, or that they have a team of five developers along with two developers from Gizra and a many &lt;a href=&quot;http://hwp.harvard.edu/people&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; working on it &lt;em&gt;full time&lt;/em&gt;, or you are not aware to the amount of contributions given back to the community… You do now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migrate, and baking content</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;A small problem in Drupal occurs when developing new modules, or installation profiles. Content.
It goes missing, and without it developing can go wrong very quickly. Also, starting up a site’s install profile that reveals a site without content gives a feel of walking into an empty bakery shop. There’s ovens, flour, and bakers, and that great bakery smell all around, but no bread. And possible clients go to other bakeries if you run out of bread. So to solve this issue, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/migrate&quot;&gt;Migrate&lt;/a&gt;  module helps us fill up the shop with bread.
Oh, and you can also migrate data from other (older) sites.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Some title, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/nodejs&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; module for Drupal is so great and a time saver, I’ve got spare time to blog about how to set it up. Future me, we’ll thank me for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s define the goals for this blog post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how to setup the Node.js module and server on a &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup on  a remote server using Heroku and Pantheon&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Message-subscribe - A New Subscription System</title>
        <description>
          &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drupal 6 had Messaging &amp;amp; Notification
Drupal 7 has Message-subscribe &amp;amp; Message-notify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message_subscribe&quot;&gt;Message-subscribe&lt;/a&gt; is a new module in the Message stack, that finally ties everything together to give us the ability to subscribe to content, and send notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know Message you already know that some development skills, or knowing Rules really really good are needed. This post will go over the main concepts and flow of the notification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message-subscribe, just like Message module has zero knowledge about your business logic - it is up to you to implement the Message creation. What Message subscribe gives you, though, is one simple function your implementing module will call – and that’s it. It will take care of it from there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/a&gt; module’s inclusion in the upcoming version of Commerce Kickstart, and it’s very likely inclusion in Drupal Commons 7 turns this not very known module into an important module to know about.
Message can help with many tasks from simple logs to complicated activity streams and even, with the use of  Message Notify module, multilingual digest emails.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>About strong partnership and winning a game of bowling</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;We are too old - or so we thought - to still be naïve.
You might be familiar with the feeling – you and reps of some other company are sitting and talking and talking about possible cooperation, and you are so hoping that this time it’s for real. You actually force yourself to believe that it’s the real thing this time, when suddenly the other party says something along the lines of quality not being quite so important to them, or that they don’t believe in contributing to the community.  Heck, at some point, we were even told by the other side that it was their belief that we should work for free, damn it.
Do you dig what I am saying?  You know, one cannot even be sure it’s an age thing, maybe it’s just a matter of having experience; either way, we are no longer naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to deal with colliding aliases</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Here’s a common problem with aliases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users/[user:name]/blog&lt;/code&gt; – This is a page defined by Panels. It shows a list of latest blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users/[user:name]/blog/[node:title]&lt;/code&gt; – This is the alias of the node that is a blog post. But if you will try to use it, Drupal thinks you refer to the Panels page, and shows you the lastest blog posts, instead of the node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Banner rotator</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;A common design element we see lately in a lot of sites is a banner rotator - image slideshow with some text and links on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several modules that try to deal with it in Drupal (such as “ddblock”, which we don’t use), however we find that using the good old Views slideshow module can give us everything we need. The following blog post gives an overview of how we achieved this task without any code, just Views configuration and a bit of CSS. As always we provide a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/sandbox/RoySegall/1442236&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that can be installed and enabled (visit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/banner-rotator&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Commerce product + Subform</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form&quot;&gt;Inline entity form&lt;/a&gt; module that was created after this post was published.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will go over an example (yet fully functionally) module that shows how we can embed a commerce product form inside a node form, and have the node reference the commerce product - without horrible hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sending LOTS of emails (Hint: with Drush)</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;On my &lt;a href=&quot;/content/message-notify-multilingual-email-notifications&quot;&gt;last blog&lt;/a&gt; post I talked about Message notify module, and mentioned we were using it to send digest emails. While Message notify really eases the pain of creating personalized emails, and sending them, we still needed to find a scalable solutions for sending lots of emails. LOTS of emails!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing it on hook_cron() is nice if you need to send few emails, but when you need to send thousands of emails a day, it won’t do. Cron will take too long, or might hang up if we try to process too many digest emails at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice and simple solution we came up with, was to write a Drush command that will process a small batch of users, and use Jenkins to fire up this command every two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will demonstrate the code, that can be used by others - however you will need to copy and change the command to fit your business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Message notify - Multilingual email notifications</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Email notification is a convenient way to be updated about new content or comments. There are several modules in Drupal that already deal with this issue, and I would like to propose another solution, and highlight the advantages of using it. The new system relies on &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message_notify&quot;&gt;Message-notify&lt;/a&gt; module, which depends on the Message module -  a general logging system (think activity stream, but without a fancy query builder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message module itself is pretty simple. You can have different message types, and when you want to create a message, you actually create a new entity called Message.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OG7 and Entity reference - Part 2</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Following my &lt;a href=&quot;/content/og7-and-entity-reference-sponsor-me&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; post, and after getting some great reaction from the community via IRC and in Drupalcamp Toulouse, I’d like to share both my thoughts about the sponsoring and about the technical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sponsoring, which already has &lt;a href=&quot;http://funnymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;FunnyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; committing to pay almost half the price, and providing on top of that developer hours, was something I’ve decided to do only after I was convinced there are some big players using OG7.
The thing is that _anyway I intend to do this change. The sponsoring is just giving it a boost, and making sure it will be _sooner than later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy I was able to post that request and to get good reaction from the community.
I’m equally happy that Planet Drupal isn’t swamped with such requests. It’s not about Drupal App. It’s about harnessing the community towards a goal. Companies offering to assist by providing developer hours is exactly the proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s a quick overview of the planned changes. First the conceptual changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of OG having it's own field type, we easily hook into Entity reference field, as it allows registering our own handler using a CTools plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of saving the field values _and the OG membership as we currently do, we save the OG membership, and use hook_field_load() to populate the Entity reference with the correct value. Yes, I know, the docs clearly say that we should not load fieldable entities in hook_field_load() as it might cause loading recursion, so we'll just make sure you can't attach group-audience fields to OG membership (which anyway doesn't make much sense). The benefit of doing that, after a long talk with the people form the community, notably fago (thanks again fago!), came out as the best solution for a problematic thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OG membership is now tightly coupled with the field that it belongs to. This means we can care about the field cardinality (i.e. how many OG membership can be created per field), and since we know the OG membership type we can provide smarter metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can have multiple fields, to allow subscribing users/ content to group with different membership type. No more hard-coding of the field name as-well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneak preview time…
As usual we can make a content type (Clubs in this example) a group, through the content type edit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OG7 and Entity reference - Sponsor me</title>
        <description>
          &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update 3: &lt;a href=&quot;http://treehouseagency.com/&quot;&gt;Treehouse Agency&lt;/a&gt; are sponsoring and providing developer help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update 2: Dev version is out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update 1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://funnymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;FunnyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; are sponsoring and providing developer help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking back home from work and thinking to myself Drupal thoughts. One of the thought was about OG7 and its use of “group” entity. At the time of writing OG it seemed as a good idea. It allows flexibility of showing all the groups of the site, without worrying what entity type they are (as the group ID isn’t equal to the node ID).
It also allows easier internalization of group nodes, as again the group ID isn’t the node ID.
In a very Drupal like way, in the other side of the world, a day later fago was asking the same question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a year that OG7 is out, it seems that the flexibility of showing all the groups at once has a price in complexion. It makes Views require one more relationship. It makes Panels require one more relationship. It makes creating Rules and using tokens a non-intuitive task.
I’ve opened a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/1342632&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;, with one thing in mind – deprecating the group entity, and making OG even slimmer and even more robust.
The idea is to rely on the new kid on the block - Entity Reference, which means your reference field will know how to reference a group of a single entity type. That change will result with changing the signature of a lot of function in OG (i.e. instead of passing the group ID, one will have to pass the entity type of the group, and the entity ID of the group), but it will also result with better UX and DX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to create a 2.x branch, to allow people to migrate from 1.x. I honestly don’t think it will be very painful, as I’ll provide automatic migration of data. So it will be just a matter of updating the Views, Panels and custom code.
In the above issue there are already comments from known community members giving it a big +1, and saying “Let’s see this sooner than later”. I also want to see this happening _fast, but my time resources are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for someone to sponsor this huge and non-trivial feature, which will cost US$7,500
Please do &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me if you are interested. I will credit you on the OG module page, in the README file, and on this blog. The community will thank you greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>About that walk bojanz, Damz and I had in London</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Another Drupalcon is getting closer, and the sessions are open for votes. Let’s clear the technical stuff first - please vote for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/og7-pride-and-prejudice&quot;&gt;OG7 session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after all the required link clicking has been done we can talk about that walk Bojan Živanović (bojanz), Damien Tournoud (Damz) and I had in London. It was the night commerce module was officially released. I somehow found myself in a restaurant with the rest of the commerce guys celebrating the event. After some good paeia and a french amount of wine we headed back to the hotel. We were talking about the day we had in Druplcaon London, the sessions we attended and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah, you had your core conversation”, I said to Damien. “You were talking about Document oriented storage, right. What is it exactly?” I asked.
Damien, being Damien, gave me a Damien answer. Bojan, being Bojan, explained it to me. You should have heard what he was talking about. Seriously, I imagined people literally banging their heads in the table, and I think I even imagined someone bursting into flames. I think it’s called self combustion - it happens to geeks when they hear such ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that ,there was a minute of silence before I asked Damien how did the people react, and did he think they liked it. Damien, well, you know. He just said - but this time with a little smile - “I don’t know if they liked it, but it sure was disruptive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I had my own presentation. It’s no secret some parts of it were completely non-linear. If I may, I would use Damien’s answer to describe my own presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Here’s my presentation held in Drupalcamp Spain. I’m going over a new feature in OG7, that allows having multiple group audience fields and having a membership type assigned to each field – in English it means that you can have some users join a group with “Default” membership and others with “Expire” membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also checkout Pedro’s (pcambra) new suit!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>User modal</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/user_modal&quot;&gt;user modal&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting module we’ve been working lately in gizra for &lt;a href=&quot;http://medico.com&quot;&gt;Medico.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d like to share our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui segments&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;ui attached center aligned segment&quot;&gt;

    

    
    &lt;div class=&quot;ui image&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gizra.com/http://drupal.org/files/images/user-modal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;User modal example from Medico.com&quot; title=&quot;User modal example from Medico.com&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the README:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
User modal module allows opening the Register/ Login/ Reset password menu items
as tabs. Since the tabs are shown via JS and not AJAX, this may lead to a better
user experience, as there is no time waiting for the selected tab to load.
Furthermore, the user modal form can be used by other implementing modules, and
for example allow a user to submit a node and register in the same time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>OG 7.x-1.1-RC2 is out! </title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The 2nd release candidate of OG7 is out, and it’s probably a good time to tell the (Drupal) planet about what’s new and about the things that I learned since the first official release (See OG’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/og&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest release candidate link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things, mostly related to Drupal, I’ve learned since Og-7.x-1.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-migration&quot;&gt;Data migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OG6 and OG7 have different tables and different data. OG7 has its tables, its fields and its related entities (group and group membership – I’ll soon go over those). At first I tried migrating it via hook_update_N(). I still feel the burns! “Your hook_update_N() shouldn’t assume anything about the state of a module or it’s API”, said fago, and I listened. Just like CCK has content-migrate module, OG7 has og-migrate. Whenever a module needs to migrate data, they can set a variable to TRUE, implement og-migrate plugins (a la CTools), and the job is done. This means design decisions (and oh boy I had a few) can be rectified without many struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fields-and-entities&quot;&gt;Fields and entities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OG7 has two important fields and an entity that acts as a meta-data related to that field. og-group field, which is a Boolean field that marks if a node is a group, when is set to TRUE creates a group entity that holds the group ID, entity ID, creation data, group label etc’. So far so good, no problems here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second field is group-audience that holds the the information about the relation a piece of content has with a group (i.e. membership). As of 7.x-1.1 whenever a user selects groups in this field, a group membership entity is created that holds the group ID, entity ID, membership state (i.e. active, pending, blocked) etc’.
The group membership idea is awesome (thanks donquixote). The problem is actually the field. If we delete a group there is no field API bulk update, that will remove the deleted group from the member’s field. So, the group membership entities have the most up-to-date data, and the fields might not have. After 7.x-1.1 is out I intend to still use the field for it’s widget and formatter, but not as storage. I mean, after a user will select the groups in group-audience field, OG will create the group membership entities, but the fields its will not be written to the DB. I think it’s interesting that also other modules (Field-collection, Relation) decide to use a field but not for it’s storage which is probably the main purpose, but for it’s generic interaction with the entities’ form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking-of-module-renaming&quot;&gt;(Thinking of) module renaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t do it. Seriously, I’m now stuck with some hybrid of og / group in places I prefer not to change. It’s not horrible, but if your the Anal type it bothers a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CTools context tutorial</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Why should you use panels node-preview-example module? You shouldn’t, it’s just an example ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covers how to build a CTools content-type plugin that has context. CTools “Context” should not be mistaken with the context module. Context is CTools way of saying, my plugin (read, block) shouldn’t be dumb. If it requires a node or a user to extract data from, then it should let others know about it. “Others” in our case is Page manager module. It will load the context for the plugins and hand it over. In fact, if the context is not present it will not even bother loading the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created an example module called node-preview-example, that you can simply download and enable, create an Article page, and see how Panels is now showing the body field on the left and on the right a (silly) “Summary” of the node – this is our plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;This is the 2nd part of the tutorial. You can see the 1st part &lt;a href=&quot;/content/data-migration-part-1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have imported the users using  the basic tools of migration module. We will learn to import references (nid or uid) and files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/migrate_extras&quot;&gt;migrate extras&lt;/a&gt; module .
Migrate extra module enables import of file field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following  example demonstrate how to import the old cars table.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Migration - part 1</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Moving an old site to Drupal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following article will discuss the right way to do this using the module &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/migrate&quot;&gt; Migrate (version2)&lt;/a&gt;.
Migrate V2 uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/drush&quot;&gt;Drush&lt;/a&gt; (Drupal Shell)  to execute the migration functions, if your are not familiar with Drush I suggest looking into this very powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the main challenges I have faced during the process :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Mapping old information to the new structure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Mapping the old values to match the new fields.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Moving the references between the old objects into Drupal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Drupalcamp Athens</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;I’m back from &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalcamp.gr/&quot;&gt;Drupalcamp Athens&lt;/a&gt;. When I met Nektarios Sylligardakis and George Papadongonas in Copenhagen they told me Greece was a Joomla country and Drupal wasn’t well known, so my expectations were not very high. That’s why I was so surprised. Not only did I find a large and warm community, but I found myself waiting for the presentations to start so I could learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Greek sucks, and since they understood that their presentations can have an appeal world-wide, most of the people gave the presentations in English. Varnish, Cloud computing, Security issues, Crazy clients with crazy demands and even crazier implementations were some of the topics. Not all movies have been uploaded yet, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user426096/videos/sort:date&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are at least some of them. It’s worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my stay was very short I still had the chance to see the Acropolis a la &lt;a href=&quot;http://acquia.com/blog/drupal-greece&quot;&gt;Robert Douglass&lt;/a&gt; style. This means storming out of the hotel - because my presentation starts in less than two hours - jumping inside a taxi, checking out every spot really quickly, taking a photo or two, back in the taxi, and we’re back. It was much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A moment of Zen #1</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Organic groups for Drupal 7 has an alpha release. Sure there are bugs, but I try not to let it ruin the warm and fuzzy feeling of seeing all the tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rounded corners</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Edit: I have found a better solution that allows using CSS3 on IE as-well – &lt;a href=&quot;http://css3pie.com/&quot;&gt;CSS3PIE&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS is annoying and I’d like to deal with it as little as possible. For that I’m using 960 grid design, I’ve started looking into LESS, and the latest is a rewrite I did to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/rounded_corners&quot;&gt;Rounded corners&lt;/a&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounded corners is no longer a “dumb” wrapper for the jQuery plugin, but rather an API that lets you do what you want with as little code possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Message example = Github news feed</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;It’s time for some P.R. (Public relations) on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/a&gt; module, and the best way is a Message example module that loosely imitates Github’s news feed feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t get into too much explanation here, just look at the screenshots, or try it yourself - since everything in Message is exportable, you don’t need to do anything to make it work! (Apart of generating nodes and “making friends” by flagging other users).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OG7 session in Drupalcon Copenhagen</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ve been able to collect all the movies and edit them together. Unfortunately the quality isn’t great in the first few minutes, but it’s getting better and I hope you’ll enjoy watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our “camera guys” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidm_en&quot;&gt;David Mollière&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/401243&quot;&gt;Peter Stumpf&lt;/a&gt; (that as it turns out, is really working for the UN and uses OG for that!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let sleeping dogs lie</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Here’s the story in one (code) line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;find ./ -name *.* -type f -exec s -i &quot;s/group/og/g&quot; '{}' \;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the humans amongst us, I’ll explain. As part of the rewrite of Organic groups to Drupal 7, I thought that the name also deserves a rename – to follow Drupal’s naming standards. Since there weren’t enough votes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.drupal.org/node/75988/&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; in g.d.o I’ve decided _not to go with the change. OG module will keep its name - although in the UI we will use “Group” (the same way as node is refereed to as content).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Views and Panels Ajaxified</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t read Roger Lopez &lt;a href=&quot;http://zroger.com/blog/ajax-without-javascript/&quot;&gt;Ajax without Javascript&lt;/a&gt; take a 5 minutes break and do it. If you are not a developer and all this code makes you frightened then you are excused. This post will also have a little code, but take a big breath and you’ll see how easy it is to Ajaxify your Panels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download this &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B943t2AqZZxCNEFzcHhpRGFUWGM/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; and the related modules &lt;code&gt;drush dl ctools panels views &amp;amp;&amp;amp; drush en page_manager panels views_content views_ui story_list php -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a few story nodes (title and body), or use Devel generate module to do it for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;code&gt;/story-list&lt;/code&gt; and you should see a list of the last 10 stories on the left and the body of the first story on the right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on any of the titles and notice how the body text changes, without any page load. Hooray!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Message module and CTools $plugin</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;If I may quote myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm thinking, _which is easier than actually sitting down and writing a patch, that it would be neat if CTools exportables plugin had a uniform UI that modules such as Context, Message and others to come, could use. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a scratch your own itch world aren’t we, huh? So I’ve created a CTools repository in github, created a branch called export-ui and it resulted with this &lt;del&gt;getting-close-to-commit&lt;/del&gt; committed &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/787644&quot;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/a&gt; I had some understanding of how CTools exportables work but having merlinofchaos review my work, explain some of his thoughts and providing his golden code, really changed the way I look at writing generic and reusable code. In fact, I’ve decided to overhaul much of the Message module for it to be more inline with CTools’ standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message was a inspired by Context module. Context uses some object oriented, so I’ve copied that too. That’s where I got it wrong - because my use case was a bit different. OOP is powerful _when it’s needed but sometimes it might be an overkiller. Ok, so no OOP, but I still needed a pluggable system. CTools has the $plugin concept. Its almost the same as having an info hook, only it’s without a hook - you place it directly on an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inc&lt;/code&gt; file that CTools will include for you when its needed. But the “trick” that I’ve learned - and there shouldn’t be any drum rolls cause it might be obvious - is to use a “process” function that populates the $plugin with defaults. The defaults can be for example the callbacks that will be used, the Views handlers that will be automatically declared, the text strings, the allowed operations, etc’. Basically, when you use the $plugin, you should be thinking how an extending module can alter the module’s behavior by simple changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Code sample for DrutNet API - connect, load node, save node and upload file</title>

          &lt;p&gt;In the previous &lt;a href=&quot;/content/drutnet-drupal-net-api&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I’ve introduced DrutNet API with an already compiled example, today I will show some code examples.
Since last post I’ve added a new method that allow file upload with Services, using the base-64 conversion, I will show you how this method works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Group (the new OG) intro</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;In the past few month, since Drupalcon Paris, I was busy upgrading Organic groups (a.k.a OG) to Drupal7. I’d like to give a quick overview of what has been done, what needs to be done, and the changes that came with the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first noticeable thing is that like Ubecart became Commerce, Organic groups has changed its name to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/group&quot;&gt;Group&lt;/a&gt;. The second thing you will notice, is that Group is a complete rewrite of OG! Why was it done? OG is a great module, and it has been around for a long time. Long enough to be very popular and feature rich, but on the same time, concepts and implementations that were right in earlier Drupal versions became outdated. Using Drupal 7 new features - especially field API - were too hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the Group’s main concepts, by importance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow associating entities (e.g. node, users, etc'.) to other entities - In plain English it means that you can have posts related to a group. Not more, not less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce the concept of roles and permissions, on the group level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide integration with superior modules such as Views. We don't need to invent the wheel - just need to know how to hook into an existing one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing those concepts down made it easier to determine what should be in the core of Group and what should be a contrib module. The UI was separated to another module as-well, leaving us with a Group API module, that has as little assumptions as possible about how it will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DrutNet -  Drupal .NET API </title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;DrutNet is a .NET API to create client applications that connects to a Drupal site, and allow file upload, node save/load, view get and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;
I’ve created this simple API to connect Drupal with .NET applications easily and quickly, this API was based on an API that I wrote for one of our projects, for this project we had to create a few client application to upload files, connect to desktop application and update the content. I used two different interfaces to cover all my needs, cURL - to upload files; and Services module - to create/ update nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features Snapshot&lt;/strong&gt;
DrutNet API has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services.Login - Login to Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services.NodeGet - Load a node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services.UserGet - Load a user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Services.NodeSave - Save a node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Zen-960</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Since writing this post ninesixty theme has advanced. I am now using it as my base theme, and create a subtheme. I no longer use Zen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/zen&quot;&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; is my first favorite base theme. &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/ninesixty&quot;&gt;Ninesixty&lt;/a&gt; is the other. The following post will show how we can enjoy both of them - How we can have a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/zen_ninesixty&quot;&gt;Zen-960&lt;/a&gt;” theme _done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, lets first understand _why we want to combine those two themes.
JohnAlibn’s Zen is a great starter theme - if you need a list of features, just head to the project page, you won’t be disappointed.
dvessel’s Ninesixty takes the power of grid 960 -that we really love as it allows us to spend less time banging our heads on CSS - and adapts it to Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that I look at it - Zen should be doing the job of defining the page _elements (how fonts will look, lists, tabs, etc’) and defining their RTL equivalent.  Ninesixty on the other hand should be doing the job of defining the page _layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the problem? Well, according to Drupal I’m too griddy! I want my theme to have two base themes - and that’s currently not possible. Ok, so why not just download zen_ninesixty theme (a.k.a Zen-960) and go on with my life?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dynamic landing pages</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;The following post will cover how to create dynamic landing pages. First lets define our mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow easily creating landing pages, with different content. The layout should be a header and footer which are always the same, and the main-content should be three columns layout, with dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;When I decided I’ll use CTools for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/a&gt; module, I knew it will save me some time. I mean, everybody knows the “let’s re-use the same API” concept. I started copying from Context module the parts that I needed, and added my own logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve decided it is time to add a message UI module. It took me about twenty minutes which ended with the commit message: “Added message UI - A shameless copy/ paste from Context module.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was much faster than what I thought it would be. So, it’s not just about using the same API, it is about using the API the _same way as others. And if “others” are yhahn and jmiccolis then I can sleep better at night (or at least when the baby doesn’t cry).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking 960</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://960.gs/&quot;&gt;960 grid system&lt;/a&gt; you should be. In one sentence, 960 is a CSS framework that divides a page to 12 or 16 columns with a total of 960 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;960 is a framework. As so, it doesn’t only give us tools, it also encourages us to use them the _right way. I think it’s a bit like forms API in Drupal that helps us build our forms correctly.
In 960 you have CSS classes that can be used to set elements width and position.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>User points - Rules style</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicklewis.org/40-essential-drupal-6-modules&quot;&gt;Nick Lewis&lt;/a&gt; wrote about his 40+ essential modules, and I really missed two modules there - Rules and Flag.
I commented that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My top 5 are: Views, CCK, Flag, Rules, Panels. I think that the Flag &amp;amp; Rules combo is less known in the community, but there are so many use cases they can cover. Because they are a bit abstracted it's hard for newbies to realize their potential.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s no better way to show my point, than a tutorial. Lazy people can even download the feature from &lt;a href=&quot;/sites/default/files/user_points_rules.tar_.gz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This tutorial will be about having “User points” functionality without using the user points module. I’m not saying that module is bad, but sometimes I need multiple user points per user. Also, re-using existing modules always feels me with great joy. GREAT joy! Also, thinking about Drupal 7 with fields API, suddenly _user points can become _any-fieldable-entity points…
The tutorial will cover the “Rule sets” concept in Rules module, which is also considered by many as a great mystery. Let’s define our mission:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organic groups 7!</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;You might have already heard, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyrve.com/maintainership&quot;&gt;Moshe Weitzman&lt;/a&gt; has handed over Organic groups to me. It’s fun and scary at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s is now time for some community “tough love” - OG7 needs reviews.
Before people start diving into the code, you should realize that OG has changed and its concept has been polished and can be summarized into one line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
OG brings roles and permissions to the _group level.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Using git to write patches</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Drupal is using CVS for version controlling core and contrib modules. CVS has diffing options, but it becomes annoying when you try adding or deleting new files. Here’s an example of how to use git to patch a contrib module - Organic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outsourcing and Kittens</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;Few years back there was a real hype about outsourcing development projects. I was working and living in New-Delhi, India at that time, and you could almost see the buzz of “outsourcing” in the air - people were so excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hype, like all hypes, has ended. People realized that paying low prices might cost more if things didn’t turn out as they expected them to. Don’t get me wrong, there are lots of talented people, but there were just as much unprofessional ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of outsourcing is still good and valid - you move your projects into places where it will cost you less - as simple as that. Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how will you know if the people you are communicating over via email (cause you can’t understand their accent when you talk in Skype) are the right people for you? The price is ok , maybe a little high than what you imagined but the timetable they show you sounds realistic more or less - but can they deliver?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know almost for sure send the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hi,

Can you please hook_update_6000() my site. I'll need some basic fago to go with the user registration, and later allow quicksketching nodes. Oh, and we really want to have some chaos going all over the site, and can you take out that function Crell _really hates?

btw, Do you think kittens will die in the process?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t hire them if they answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
WTF?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire them if they answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Howdy,

So you want to upgrade your site to Drupal 6, add content profile module to the user registration, allow users to flag nodes, and add some CTools love to it?
Meh, no kittens should die.

p.s. About Crell - don't worry, we know better than to use arg().
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. I’m not 100% serious about sending such an email - my point is this - If they are involved in the community, know the people and speak the lingo, they are probably aware of which modules are good and have a future; they probably know the best practices for deployment; they probably know how to write _secure code. So even if they charge more than another company, but that company answered “WTF”? - go with the more expensive company, as in the end it will cost you less.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Does every page really need to be a node?</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;No.
Let’s take the “usual” home page as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't need to have an author&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It rarely changes (Maybe it has Views in it that change the content that is shown, but the layout and static text don't change)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/panels&quot;&gt;Panels&lt;/a&gt; for that. It also makes deployment easier:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>hook_widget_settings_alter() and Pandora</title>
        <description>
          &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/user/39593&quot;&gt;markus_petrux&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems that the new addition to CCK, the new hook_widget_settings_alter() opened Pandora's box.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few modules that attach their own logic to CCK fields. Up until now those modules had to have their own DB or set their own variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CCK 2.5, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hook_widget_settings_alter()&lt;/code&gt; got in, which allows your module to hook into the field settings, and rely on CCK to save and load those settings when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all - as the settings are becoming part of the CCK field defention it means that when you’ll export the CCK to code - your module settings will be there. Your module now actually has import/ export functionality without you even having to bother about.&lt;/p&gt;
