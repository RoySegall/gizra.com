                      <h3>Gizra is a 20+ person company, located in central Tel Aviv and US.</h3>
                      <p>
                        We work solely with Open Source technologies, some of our products are themselves released as Open Source.
                        Our contributions help power websites like whitehouse.gov, The Economist, MSNBC and others.
                        Among our clients are Harvard University, the European Commission and the UN.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It's important to us to work on interesting projects, with advanced technologies and clients who see us as partners.
                        In particular we love projects that challenge us to figure out new stuff - technology and otherwise - and we look for
                        people with a similar mindset.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Everyone at Gizra can code. We aim to hold ourselves to the highest coding standards and constantly seek
                        better ways to do our work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We're looking for curious and passionate people, who can get things done - and understand that in a small company
                        no task is below or above anyone. Formal education is not required, a GitHub account is. Most of our work is in
                        <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank"> Drupal</a>,
                        PHP and JS (with some <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm</a>, Node.js, and starting to look at Haskell's Yesod), but we understand that if you're good with
                        one you'll pick up the others.
                      </p>
