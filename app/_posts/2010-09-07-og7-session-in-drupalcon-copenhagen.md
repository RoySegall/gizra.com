Finally, we've been able to collect all the movies and edit them together. Unfortunately the quality isn't great in the first few minutes, but it's getting better and I hope you'll enjoy watching it.

Thanks to our "camera guys" - <a href="http://twitter.com/davidm_en">David Molli√®re</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/401243">Peter Stumpf</a> (that as it turns out, is really working for the UN and uses OG for that!)

For those who want too see the technical stuff from the session I gave should follow <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/GrouptheNewOrganicGroups-BuildingSocialNetworksInDrupal7">this</a> link. I hope this will encourage people o try out Organic groups for Drupal 7 and help in making it a great module.
