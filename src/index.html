        Everybody tells us that people won’t read this. They will enter the site,
        see mostly text, and move on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe they're right. But we think it's not that people don’t want to
        read; rather they don’t want to read boring, meaningless marketing copy.

        So how about this - your problem is not a technology one. Quite
        surprising coming from a technology company, right? But it's true.
        It's not about having a responsive design, or an add to cart, or some
        fancy feature. It's about what is needed to support your goals - how you
        define success and measure it.

      <p>
        Let's be honest, most IT projects fail - they don't meet the deadline,
        they exceed the budget, and no one seems to be pleased. If this were a
        one-on-one meeting, this is the point in our pitch we would look into
        your eyes and search for that spark of understanding. Some have it,
        some don't. If you are still reading this, it's safe to assume you know
        what we are talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's 2017. We're in an age where things are moving really fast. No one
        will wait for you 9 month. Heck, we'd argue no one will wait for you 9
        minutes. So you need to get it out there. Fast. And get real feedback
        from real people. Fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forget those long specifications; forget those over-engineered features
        before there's even a single user; forget those old fashioned work
        methods that just add bureaucracy, but don't guarantee results.
      </p>

      <p>
        We care only about the results. We've failed many times. Way too many
        times. But we have also had our good share of success. You see, this is
        not in theory, it's about experience and the constant understanding that
        "there must be a better way". And it’s working for Harvard University,
        the EU, the UN, and many other startups and NGOs. If you are ready to
        take this path with us, it will work for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, we're not your typical web development agency. When we partner
        with you, it's not just as developers, but rather as business
        technologists. We're committed to one thing - making your project
        successful, so our relationship with you lasts for many years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you contact us, we will know how to guide you in this process.
        We've done it many times. But this first crucial step of contacting us
        is in your hands.
