      <p class="first">
        Everyone tells us that people won’t read this. They'll enter the site,
        see lots of text, and move on.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe they're right. But we think it's not that people don’t want to
        read; rather they don’t want to read boring, meaningless marketing copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s really difficult to explain exactly who we are. It's not that we haven't
        tried, but we inevitably ended up using words that have long lost their meaning.
        Seriously, how can words like &ldquo;trust&rdquo; or &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;
        be taken seriously when stuck inside a tag line? Plus, this exercise of describing
        yourself in short is incomplete. Can you explain in one sentence who you are? Even
        if you could, wouldn’t it be missing so much?
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, we believe writing this is worth the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we wrote three (short) stories that we hope will give you a glimpse into our
        mindset. We have a good feeling about this, but who knows - it's for you to decide.
