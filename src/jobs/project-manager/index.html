    <p>
      Gizra is a 25+ person company, based in central Tel Aviv and the U.S. and with remote
      employees around the globe. Our organization is becoming more distributed every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work solely with Open Source technologies, some of our products are themselves released as Open Source.
      Our contributions help power websites like whitehouse.gov, The Economist, MSNBC and others.
      Among our clients are Harvard University, the European Commission, and the United Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to us to work on interesting projects, with advanced technologies and clients who see us as partners.
      In particular we love projects that challenge us to figure out new stuff - technology and otherwise - and we look for
      people with a similar mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone at Gizra can code (even project managers some). We aim to hold ourselves to the highest standards and constantly seek
      better ways to do our work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're looking for curious and passionate people, who can get things done - and understand that in a small company
      no task is below or above anyone. Our project managers know how to guide projects from beginning to end, taking both 
      a wide view, and getting hands dirty fro time to time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal education is not required, a GitHub account is. Most of our work is in
      <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank"> Drupal</a>, PHP and <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm</a>.
