  You peek at your watch, you have another five minutes. Fifteen, if you deduct
  the minutes you have added to keep on the safe side. Talk of gender equality,
  you think bitterly to yourself seventeen minutes later, when you are finally
  rushing to your car. The preschool closes in twenty-five minutes, and you
  have carefully planned out every single minute, while the other seven
  directors &mdash; the men &mdash; who had sat with you at the board meeting
  are still going strong. They don't have to pick up a girl from preschool.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;A digital revolution,&rdquo; that is the topic. If you doesn't take
  into account all the discussions over the past two years, then you could say
  that we have been discussing the &ldquo;new&rdquo; topic quite intensively
  for almost three months now. The amount of nonsense brought up during the
  meetings can only compete with the number of empty words uttered. And
  it's not like you haven't explained or made remarks. But at this point,
  despite the fact that it sounds almost illogical, it seems the term
  &ldquo;the proof is in the pudding&rdquo; is still not clear to everybody. At
  least the Big Boss understands it: the man who appreciates you, who promoted
  you. But you know how it is &mdash; organizational politics.
</p>
<p>
  Once you are the car, you start unbuttoning your suit. A power suit, it's
  called. How ridiculous to give such a name to a modern-day girdle. At the
  first traffic light (three and a half minutes, with a huge television screen
  flashing commercials about nothing) you are already in your sneakers.
</p>
<p>
  The Big Boss is probably the only one who understands about the proof being
  in the pudding, as you do. But he belongs to a different generation. He
  relies on his instincts, but not only. And in the meanwhile, as expected: the
  never-ending meetings, the reports, the conclusions, the audits, the
  follow-up meetings. Just a minute, stop! The audit for the quarter is coming
  up… and once again &mdash; meetings, reports, conclusions, more audits.
</p>
<p>
  Just as long as you are not late for preschool. Honestly, you have never been
  late. But it's your biggest fear. Screw them at work. Your daughter will not
  be the last one there. That's what matters right now.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday you sent an email to the Big Boss. It was quite a big deal on your
  part, because what you sent was what you had been working on for the past
  month &mdash; the month when you had had enough of all the talk, and simply
  wanted to find the people who would actually be able to help you with the
  &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; The people from the other company, who had indeed
  helped you, also joked about it. Okay, come on let's just start the
  revolution &mdash; said the man. And let's finish it in a month from now,
  said the woman. Yep, there is no time to waste, all three of you agreed. All
  of you had kids to pick up from preschool.
</p>
<p>
  In fact it wasn't even necessary to explain to them all that much what was
  really important. Maybe when one has kids to pick up from preschool, or
  school, or when one has a clear set of priorities it becomes almost
  self-evident.
</p>
<p>
  The Big Boss was awed. In a good sense, that is. He wrote: &ldquo;OMG!&rdquo;
  And you have to know him to understand just how awesome that is, coming from
  him. In all honesty, the guy is really stingy when it comes to complementing,
  and that's putting it mildly. In the email you sent him there were only two
  words: &ldquo;The pudding&rdquo;, and a link to the digital revolution you
  had created in a month.
</p>
<p>
  You were not late. As always. Your little girl is already eating a pear you
  had sliced for her at the second traffic light (two minutes and twenty
  seconds, with no big screen), and you are sitting on a bench talking with
  other mothers.
</p>
<p>
  You know there is still a struggle ahead. But what matters is sitting next to
  you right now, eating her pear and smiling. And also the fact that you are
  simply proud of yourself. Because, after all, you must admit to yourself
  &mdash; you are pretty darn good at it.
