I had a fun conversation with Jam this morning, regarding [Zariz](/content/zariz-means-agile/) - the set of Drupal modules we're developing that (a) [brings version control into the content space](/content/zariz-in-pics/) and (b) [brings Drupal into the static site space](/content/drupal-x5-faster/). If you're into that kind of stuff, you might enjoy it too:
