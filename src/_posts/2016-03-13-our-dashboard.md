Hi there! Please meet our dashboard:

{% include thumbnail.html image_path="assets/images/posts/our-dashboard/image1.jpg" caption="Our Shoov Dashboard" %}

It's powered by [Shoov](http://shoov.io). Did we mention Shoov before? I [think](/content/shoov-ci-tests-live-site) [we](/content/cross-browser-visual-regression-with-shoov) [did](/content/visual-regression-travis-shoov-ngrok). Basically every project we work on has full test coverage - like everyone's, I know - but Shoov also provides us with a visual regression testing harness.

Shoov constantly runs its tests in the background, 24x7. When everything passes the project icon is green. When a test fails, it's red. The monitor sits in the main room, so everyone can see when there's an issue and feel deeply ashamed of their fragile, error-prone, carbon based brains.

I'm kidding of course. We all make mistakes - we're only human. But Shoov isn't.
