Here's my presentation held in Drupalcamp Spain. I'm going over a new feature in OG7, that allows having multiple group audience fields and having a membership type assigned to each field -- in English it means that you can have some users join a group with "Default" membership and others with "Expire" membership.

Also checkout Pedro's (pcambra) new suit!
