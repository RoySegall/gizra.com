**The big question:** Is it time to rebuild your site or can you do with a refresh?

**Answer:** Maybe neither. Maybe you're asking the wrong question.

As I'm breaking down my experience at NTEN's, Nonprofit Technology Conference last week, I'm recalling a lot of the conversations I had, many of which were centered around that seemingly big question. The notion looms exceedingly large in the nonprofit world, as who has that five, maybe six figure budget to redo their site? Or maybe more daunting: who has the time? Because in addition to being in charge of the organization's site, you also coordinate the entire marketing effort and you plan events too.

So the drip, drip, drip of your slightly broken, out-of-date, not-quite-meeting-your-needs website is constantly in your ear, like the leaky pipe somewhere in your wall that you can hear clearly when everything else is quiet, and you know is going to be harder to find than it will even be to repair. And it's going to cost a lot. So let's just let it keep dripping and we'll deal with it when we have enough saved - or when it becomes a real emergency.

But that's where this analogy ends. Because you're going to have to fix that pipe eventually. The leak will get bigger or you are going to have a mold problem. There's no way around it: that pipe delivers water to the rest of your house. You can't do without it.

## A Website is a Tool, Not a Product (probably)

It might not be your website that's stuck in the past - it could be that your organizational thinking about what a website is, is stuck there as well. The idea that a website is a product in itself is a natural outgrowth of the "brochureware" era, where sites were just an extension of other printed marketing materials.

Marketing is still a very important part of what a website can do - but it's very likely that either through passive analytics, or more dynamic user interactions, your website is engaging your key constituents in ways that go beyond the one-way transfer of static information. Chances are - if you are like most nonprofits - a part of your website, or some web tool you have created, helps you carry out an aspect of your mission.

But (except in some rare circumstances) the website itself isn't the mission - and that's an important distinction. Whether it's addressing hunger and poverty, building sustainable community infrastructures, preserving natural resources, or helping LGBT teens feel like they are not alone, your stakeholders support your organization not because you have a high-quality website, but because you provide a high-quality response to the issue you serve.

So why do we treat websites like an end product? Why do we ever say "We need to redo our website"? Would we ever say that we need to "redo" our development department? or our volunteer program? Rather we should say, let's adapt our website, learning from our successes and recovering from our failures.

## Neither Rebuild or Refresh

One of the things that pains me often is when I encounter organizations sitting on a horribly broken web experience because they are "saving up" for a website overhaul. They know it's broken, but they also know they don't have the money or bandwidth to deal with it. Rather than using that time to think about what they could be doing on the web, they spend it making excuses for their outdated website. I can say that bluntly because, well... been there, done that.

So just like that leaky pipe: yeah, it would be great to have all new copper pipe throughout the house. That would keep you happy for years. But in the meantime, let's fix that leak. There's probably a solution to your web problem and it's probably cheaper than a rebuild.

But what about a "refresh," you say? I'm not a fan of that either. In most cases it's a cop out to uncovering the real problem. Not that there's any problem with a prettier website or a fancier UI - but a pretty broken web experience is still just a broken experience.

## Do a Lean Discovery

{% include thumbnail.html image_path="https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/EasygoingBoldHoneyeater" caption=" Photo by Nicolas Nova, https://www.flickr.com/photos/nnova/2970063644,  (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)" %}

We've gotten in the habit of doing a "lean discovery" to start a project - and it's particularly useful in the case where you might be teetering on the edge of rebuild or refresh. It's not quite a full-blown discovery with lots of stakeholder meetings and research; there's a built-in assumption that the team we are working with has a pretty good idea about the demographic they serve and what their current web presence does and doesn't do (this is almost always the case with established nonprofits).

From our perspective, we "time box" these discoveries at about 20 hours, which keeps things affordable for clients and forces us to limit the scope and keep things simple (this has benefits down the road too, as we don't discover too many things to do). The result is a targeted list of improvements for the site - sometimes it's framed within the existing site, sometimes it's a new structure which can form the foundation for a later rebuild.

## The Hallmarks of "Lean Discovery"

1. **It seeks to achieve a business goal.** That's right, we said "business." Nonprofits have business goals too and their often better and more efficient in achieving them than businesses. And before we get started too quickly, "Driving more users to my site" is *not* a business goal. It should be simple, like: "I want to capture more signups to my mailing list" or "I want to increase the number of available volunteers" or "I want to decrease the number of errors that our social workers make when entering data about their encounters."

2. **The goals are framed in human-centered terms.** Just like your organization, on web project we are seeking to motivate "people" not "users." While Human-Centered Design is a whole other topic, it's important to note that we deal in personas rather than user roles. We can work a lot better to motivate a "recent retiree looking to fill free time" than "an anonymous user who lands on the volunteer page." Roles are fine in technical terms - we need to know who gets permission and access to what; but they don't tell us much in terms of why some one comes to or uses your site and what thy hope to achieve. Personas

3. **The goals must be testable** This really follows from the previous two, but we need some way to know that we've achieved positive results. If we met our goals, we can then look for ways to replicate our success elsewhere. We may even be able to demonstrate to stakeholders that we are on the right track and that with just a little more budget we can do even more. If we didn't meet our goals, we can correct course or even abandon ship before we've spent to much of our precious resources.

It hurts me to hear: "We just went through a redesign and we just didn't get what we wanted." It's the sign of a broken process, and an avoidable one if we shift the way we think about our websites. But it's also a recoverable scenario
