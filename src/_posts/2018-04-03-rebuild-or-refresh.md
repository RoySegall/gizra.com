## Is That Your Website Leaking?

**The big question:** Is it time to rebuild your site or can you do with a refresh?

**Answer:** Maybe neither. Maybe you're asking the wrong question.

As I'm preparing for the NTEN's, Nonprofit Technology Conference next week, I'm recalling a lot of the conversations I had last year, many of which were centered around that seemingly big question. The notion looms exceedingly large in the nonprofit world, as who has that five, maybe six figure budget to redo their site? Or maybe more daunting: who has the time? Because in addition to being in charge of the organization's site, you also coordinate the entire marketing effort and you plan events too.

So the drip, drip, drip of your slightly broken, out-of-date, not-quite-meeting-your-needs website is constantly in your ear, like the leaky pipe somewhere in your wall that you can hear clearly when everything else is quite, and you know id going to be harder to find than it will even be to repair. And it's going to cost a lot. So let's just let it keep dripping and we'll deal with it when we have enough saved - or when it becomes a real emergency.

But that's where this analogy ends. Because you're going to have to fix that pipe eventually. The leak will get bigger or you going to have a mold problem. There's no way around it: that pipe deliver's water to the rest of your house. You can't do without it.

## A Website is a Tool, Not a Product (probably)

It's might not be your website that's stuck in the past - it could be that your organizational thinking about what a website is, is stuck there as well. The idea that a website is a product in itself is a natural outgrowth of the "brochureware" era, where sites were just an extension of other printed marketing materials.

Marketing is still a very important part of what a website can do - but it's very likely that either through passive analytics, or more dynamic user interactions, your website is engaging your key constituents in ways that go beyond the one-way transfer of static information. Chances are - if you are like most nonprofits - a part of your website, or some web tool you have created, helps you carry out an aspect of your mission.

But (except in some rare circumstances) the website itself isn't the mission - and that's an important distinction. Whether it's addressing hunger and poverty, building sustainable community infrastructures, preserving natural resources, or helping LGBT teens feel like they are not alone, your stakeholders support your organization not because you have a high-quality website, but because you provide a high-quality response to the issue you serve.

So why do we treat websites like an end product? Why do we ever say "We need to redo our website"? Would we ever say that we need to "redo" our development department? or our volunteer program? Rather we should say, let's adapt our website, learning from our successes and recovering from our failures.

## Neither Rebuild or Refresh
