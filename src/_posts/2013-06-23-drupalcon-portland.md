Amitai returned from DrupalCon Portland reporting it was raining all the time, the flights were very long (apparently the "Gizra Platinum Executive Traveller" card we gave him in the office failed to deliver the expected First Class upgrade) and he still doesn't really get Portlandia.

Still, he had an awesome conference and a great presentation on Organic Groups and Message modules, sprinkled with anecdotes from the open source module developer's life. Thanks to [Pantheon's](https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/drupalcon-portland-video-amitai-burstein-organic-groups-message) video crew, you can now verify the latter claim yourself:
