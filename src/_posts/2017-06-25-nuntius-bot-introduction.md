In case you havn't noticed we are on the verge of a new era - the bot era!!
** Dramatic music in the background **

Sort of... [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4na-wZte6Co) showed
us what it can really be though we need to put our minds into our heads and
understand that bot, for now, would be more like what Brice showed us in his
Keynote at [DrupalCon Baltimore](https://youtu.be/q25eaJHpXFo?t=1h7m30s).

## Ro-bot - easy 101
So what is a bot? If you said `Hey siri`, `OK Google`, `Hey Cortona`, or `Alexa`
then you interacted with a bot. That bot received an input, returned an output
(and even said it) and did it - wake you up, remind you, send an email or order
your new book from Amazon and you if you got lucky, a Drone delivered it for
you(but, that out of the blog post scope).

## What are the platforms and technologies
After understanding what is a bot let's start and see how can we write one. Now,
any chat platform have provide bot in some way or another and there are two
ways:
1. Websockets - Though we use this technology for push events to the user's
browser, platforms provides a websocket channel and push events when something
happen in a channel(s) your bot is listening.
2. Webhooks - In this case you'll get http requests with the information on
events - similar to Webhooks.

Slack, Facebook Messagner, Skype, Telegram provides a integration with bot in
some way or another but, in this blog post we will focus on Slack.
