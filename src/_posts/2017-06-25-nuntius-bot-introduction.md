In case you havn't noticed we are on the verge of a new era - the bot era!!
** Dramatic music in the background **

Sort of... [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4na-wZte6Co) showed
us what it can really be though we need to put our minds into our heads and
understand that bot, for now, would be more like what Brice showed us in his
Keynote at [DrupalCon Baltimore](https://youtu.be/q25eaJHpXFo?t=1h7m30s).

## Ro-bot - easy 101
So what is a bot? If you said `Hey siri`, `OK Google` or `Alexa` then you
interacted with a bot. That bot got an input, returned an output(and even said
it) and did it - wake you up, remind you, send an email or order your new book
from Amazon and you if you got lucky, a Drone delivered it for you.

## What are the platforms and technologies

Slack, Facebook, Skype, telegram
