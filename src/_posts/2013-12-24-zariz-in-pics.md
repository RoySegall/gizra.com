[Zariz ](https://github.com/Gizra/zariz) isn't just about static sites. In fact the Zariz module itself isn't aware of any static generation. It's about modeling the content creation around Git, which is a new approach to content staging.

Here are 10 images that will make the whole idea clear.

This is the ``live`` branch  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/0.jpg' %}

We branch out of it  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/1.jpg' %}

{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/2.jpg' %}

<!-- more -->

The new branch is empty. Lets add new content to it  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/3.jpg' %}

Now that there's new content, the toolbar allows us to merge it back to the ``live`` branch  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/4.jpg' %}

Zariz supports multiple branching  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/5.jpg' %}

In the new branch we can see the content that was added in the parent branch  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/6.jpg' %}

{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/7.jpg' %}

The debug block shows us the origin of each content  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/8.jpg' %}

Once we merge the branch, it is locked and cannot be changed  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/9.jpg' %}

That's the ``live`` branch after the merge  
{% include thumbnail.html image_path='/assets/images/posts/zariz2/10.jpg' %}
