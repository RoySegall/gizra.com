I believe it's safe to say that Decoupled Drupal is here to stay. Back in DrupalCon Los Angeles my good friend [Josh Koenig](https://pantheon.io/team/josh-koenig) from [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) and I teamed up to share our experience with it.

Josh asked me if I could do the presentation with him and I immediately agreed, as Josh is an awesome presenter and I knew it's going to be fun. My answer, if I recall correctly, was:

<blockquote>If the session gets selected it will need to be partially weird. And you might need to grow a mustache for that.</blockquote>

He didn't grow a mustache. But it was fun and full of energy. And it has a lot of very pragmatic tips, such as __Headless Drupal is a terrible idea!__

Anyway, enough text - here is the video:
