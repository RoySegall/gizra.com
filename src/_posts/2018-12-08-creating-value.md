description: "Practical steps to making sure we develop only what adds value to our clients."
---

In an environment of abundance, of information, features, and possibilities, and short attention spans, of end users, stakeholders, and markets, the key to creating value is our strict filtering of what is developed - we like calling it developing “the essence.”  We believe this approach should be taken with all projects but usually clients get on-board when confronted with a time or money constraint like a price estimation five times their budget or a three month deadline to investors.

Before doing anything regarding requirements or development, we work to understand our clients’ goals. We ask questions, many, until they can tell us clearly what they want to accomplish. Every piece of scope is evaluated against this statement. These goals may be finding investment, usability readiness for market testing, gauging interest in a new market, increasing sales by a specific percentage, or providing a specific added value to end users, as is the case with many non-profits we work with.

For every introduced functionality, design, or feature, our account managers:
## Start Off Asking 'Why'?

For something to be developed, it should have a good case - it must stand against the question “does it further the client’s goals?” This is most asked before the stage of gaining end-users, so it helps to reframe the question to: “until you have 100 users, can you manage without this feature?” In this context, backend efficiency and UX enhancement features like automatic emails, reports, social login, and chatbots seem superfluous.

## Eliminate Edge Cases
In almost every case, developing a solution for a small percentage of non-critical users does not provide value to a project.  It is surprising how simple questions like - “how many users will this support?” or “how often does this occur?” changes perspective and priorities.  For one of our projects, there was a complex and important categories table that required the ability to view with various sorts and filters to effectively update it by the admin user.  We could have easily spent hours developing this but when we understood that it will be updated maximum once a year, it was taken out of the scope.

Most of the time a simple business process can support the edge cases instead of hours in wasted development. The choice to not develop for an edge case at all is also a legitimate decision. For the above example, we ended up using the existing backend interface along with a one page reference document to help the admin navigate the unfamiliar interface.  Another very reasonable solution could be to support it as a change request in the maintenance contract.  

## Cut Out the Depth of Scope
Even a specific feature should be pared down to the most basic version that still satisfies the end goal.  This is a ripe area to cut out the unessential because it is not about whether a feature should be developed - it is about how extensively it should be developed which is easier for clients to digest.

On one of our projects - at the user testing phase - the client presented a four page requirement document, representing 80 hours of development, for a complex registration, login, reset password functionality in the final week of the project.

In one fell swoop, this document was deleted and replaced by a simple username and password login without registration or reset password logic, and it took 12 hours to develop.  For the upcoming user testing this was more than enough. And subsequently even when the client’s goal evolved to increasing sales, the logic was only basically upgraded to include registration and reset password functionality and never required the massive outlined requirements that were initially presented.

## Translate to Money
We timebox the effort, translate it to money, and ask, is the value of this scope worth the cost? The perspective that a price tag provides is surprising. Is login functionality that costs $10K worth it? Maybe $3K makes a little more sense? This meets the client exactly where value is determined and helps set expectations.

## Stick to It
This disciplined approach to scoping requirements is very effective and has become second nature for our account managers. Strict filtering at the item level helps piece together a scope that represent the ‘essence’ of the project, a scope that best supports our clients’ goals, a scope with value.
