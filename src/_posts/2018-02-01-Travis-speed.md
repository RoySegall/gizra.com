Chances are that you already using Travis or another Cool CI to execute your tests, therefore everyone politely waits for CI checks before even think about merging, right? After a while, this tidiness disappears and you click on the merge: it's a trivial change and I need it now.

What are the trivial and not so trivial options to make the team always be willing to wait for the completion?

## Caching

## Software versions

## Make it parallel

## Utilize available memory

## Build your own Docker image

## +1 - Question the requirement
