## [planet.elm-lang.org](http://planet.elm-lang.org/) is live!

Nice, right? Planet Elm and its [RSS feed](http://planet.elm-lang.org/feeds.xml) is up and running - just grab it, and the best Elm related posts would appear in your favorite RSS reader.

I felt the need for such a site the day I started with Elm. Getting the Gizra devs to [build](https://github.com/Gizra/planet-elm) it was the next logical thing.

Having this main site as a central place for aggregating all the interesting content about Elm is yet another step in getting Elm into the mainstream.

If you maintain your own blog, go ahead, and [submit your RSS feeds](https://github.com/Gizra/planet-elm/wiki/Planet-Elm-guidelines).
