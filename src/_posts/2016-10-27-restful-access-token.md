For a traditional Drupal site, we don’t need to handle
authentication, because Drupal has our back - a user submits the login form,
gets a cookie, and starts using the awesome site. But what about decoupled sites?
How can we authenticate the user?

Before diving into this, we need to understand the authentication types
provided by RESTful:

  1. Cookie - Validating the user cookie is not something new for us. We have
  been doing it for years, and it's one of the first techniques web developers
  acquire. But, to validate the request we need to pass a CSRF token. This token
  helps [make sure](https://github.com/RESTful-Drupal/restful/blob/b5f717945081be3f1aa22968f140a3b6d056fea1/src/Plugin/authentication/CookieAuthentication.php#L49) the form was not a fraud. An
  example could be a form that tweets on the behalf of us on Twitter.
  The existence of a valid CSRF in the request would make sure an internet scam could
  not generate the form and upload to Twitter a photo of a cat, when you're a
  dog person.

  2. Access token - RESTful will generate an access token and bind it to the
  user. Unlike the cookie which needs a CSRF token to be valid by Restful, we
  get a two-for-one deal. The existence of the access token in the DB is
  verified and references us to the user which is represented by that access
  token.

Important: in order to use access token authentication, you’ll need
to enable the module [RESTful token authentication](https://github.com/RESTful-Drupal/restful/tree/7.x-2.x/modules/restful_token_auth)
(which is a submodule of [RESTful](https://github.com/RESTful-Drupal/restful)).

## Generating the access token

Below is how an access token is generated using Angular JS. If the
authentication process passes, the end point will return an object with 3
values:

  1. `access_token` - This is the token which represents the user in any request.
  2. `expires_in` - The amount of seconds in which the access token is valid.
  3. `refresh_token` - Once the token is no longer valid, you'll need to ask
  for a new one using the refresh token.

You can see below a small amount of Angular JS code:

```javascript
$http.get('http://localhost/drupal/api/login-token', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + Base64.encode(username + ':' + password)
  }
})
.success(function(data) {
  localStorageService.set('access_token', data.access_token);
});
```

And this is what you’ll get back:

```json
{
  "access_token": "Y3wQua-qFY-mukslgPaLqKdNmlGdBQK4dly-UhlJcYk",
  "type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "refresh_token": "xRP-nnKA05GGsN-jr80Z_hfPHqrkpyjAtevDSeTLbYU"
}
```

## Refreshing an access token
As mentioned above, the access token is only valid for a specific amount of time,
usually 24 hours, so you’ll need to check it before the request:

```javascript
if (new Date().getTime() > localStorageService.get('expire_in')) {
  var refresh_token = localStorageService.get('refresh_token');
  $http.get('http://localhost/drupal/refresh-token/' + refresh_token)
  .success(function(data) {
    localStorageService.set('access_token', data.access_token);
    localStorageService.set('refresh_token', data.refresh_token);
    localStorageService.set('expire_in', new Date().getTime() + data.expires_in);
  });
}
```

## Using the access token
OK, so we got the access token and we can refresh it when it's no longer valid.
The next thing you need to know is how to inject the access token into the
header:

```javascript
$http.post('http://localhost/drupal/api/article', {
  headers: {
    'access-token': localStorageService.get('access_token')
  },
  data: {
    'label': 'foo'
  }
})
.success(function(data) {
  console.log('Cool! You posted a new article.');
});
```
