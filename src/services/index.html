    It is not about technology. It is about your business and what you want
    to accomplish.  Instead of presenting you with a list of services that you
    may or may not need, we hope to capture what is really on your mind.
    Are any of these scenarios familiar to you?

        You have a website; you are not quite happy with it; it does not
        meet your current business needs; you are also not so sure what
        the next steps should be. There are voices saying you should redo
        the whole thing and you are underwhelmed by the idea because it
        was such an arduous process the last time.  You may have all these
        changes and additions you would like to implement, but you have no
