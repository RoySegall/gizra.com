<p>
  It’s quite difficult to explain exactly who we are. It's not that we haven't
  tried, but we inevitably ended up using words that have long lost their meaning.
  Seriously, how can words like &ldquo;trust&rdquo; or &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;
  be taken seriously when stuck inside a tag line? Plus, this exercise of describing
  yourself in short is incomplete. Can you explain in one sentence who you are? Even
  if you could, wouldn’t it be missing so much?
</p>

<p>
  In any case, we believe writing this is worth the risk.
</p>

<p>
  So we wrote three (short) stories that we hope will give you a glimpse into our
  mindset. We have a good feeling about this, but who knows - it's for you to decide.
